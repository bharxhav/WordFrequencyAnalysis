This is a case study on Data Structures using Python, for 2nd Year, 1st Semester.
The Project includes an application of data structure to create a real world application.


## Task - `Word Frequency Analysis`

Write a program that reads a file, breaks each line into words, strips whitespace and punctuation from the words, and converts them to lowercase.


## Additional Features

I also added :

- File with __Binary__ raw.
- File with __Alphabet__ raw.
- File with __Word__ raw.
- File with __Word with WhiteSpace__.
- File with __Punctuation__ raw.
- File with __Punctuation with WhiteSpace__ raw.

I added extra features such as :

- Add Frequency analysis on words, the most common used letter etc.
- Add Frequency analysis on letters, the most common used word etc.
- Prove `Benford's Law` using pyplot.


Advantage :
