leaps
then
pressing
a
furious
paul
falls
the
shield
edges
crack
loudly
as
they
touch
each

paul
directs
a
parry
and
leads
gurney
against
the
plunging
at
just
the
right
moment
to
pin
gurney
against
the
table
top
with
his

looks
and
sees

have
joined
each

in
you
did
seem
to
finally
get

paul
would
you
really
have
drawn

whit
below
your
abilities
have
scratched
you
a
good
paul
stands
and
snaps
off
his
shield
as
does
back
to
scene
paul
things
have
been
so
serious
here
gurney
i
sensed
the
play
in
you
but
this
can
no
longer
be
tomorrow
we
leave
for
arrakis
is
the
harkonnens
are
gurney
and
paul
stare
at
each
other
for
a
moment
in
yueh
moves
forward
and
begins
to
take
pulse
rate
and
to
collect
other
data
with
a
small
black
paul
do
you
have
any
information
on
the
worms
of
yueh
i
have
obtained
a
filmbook
on
a
small
only
meters
paul
they
smile
at
each
yueh
there
are
have
been
documented
sightings
of

be
in
the
desert
belt
and
the
south
polar
regions
are
marked
paul
the
storms
and
the
is
it
that
the
sand
can
blow
at
seven
hundred
kilometers
per
yueh
it
can
render
flesh
to
dust
in
and
these
dry
winds
can
generate
tremendous
static
electricity
in
the
our
body
shields
have
enough
power
to
operate
in
the
open
air
on
paul
how
do
the
fremen
survive
yueh
we
know
much
about
the

deep
some
of
them
in
the

they
have
paul
the

saturation
of
the

thufir
many
dangers
exist
on

behind
i
is
the
thufir
you
will
make
a
formidable
paul
thufir
now
the
first
step
in
avoiding
a
