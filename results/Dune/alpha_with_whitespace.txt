     Inside the Emperors chamber the TANKSUITED
     GUILDSMEN are arranging themselves in a V
     formation around the box Suddenly the box opens
     slowly and beautifully revealing a huge thick glass
     tank Inside the tank floats a THIRD STAGE NAVIGATOR
     twenty feet long much like a cross between a pasty
     pale human being and a fleshy grasshopper

     The tank is filled with swirling orange spicegas
     and Guildsmen continuously vacuum up the toxic
     chemical spills dripping from under the tank
     Suddenly the Guild Navigator swims towards the
     Emperor His head is enormous and fleshy like a
     huge grasshopper head  the eyes are totally deep
     blue His voice is a high fleshy whispering and an
     intricate electrical apparatus in the front of the
     tank translates into English and broadcasts it into
     the room

                        NAVIGATOR

                        DR YUEH
               There are have been documented sightings
               of worms as large as  meters in the
               deep desert  far from where well be in
               Arakeen The desert belt and the south
               polar regions are marked forbidden
               Why

                          PAUL
               The storms and the worms Is it true that
               the sand can blow at seven hundred
               kilometers per hour

                          YUEH
               It can render flesh to dust in minutes
               And these dry winds can generate
               tremendous static electricity in the
               atmosphere Our body shields wont have
               enough power to operate in the open air on
               Arrakis

                          PAUL
               Well how do the Fremen survive there

                          YUEH
               We dont know much about the Fremen
               They live in the deep desert some of
               them in the cities and they have blue
               withinblue eyes

                          PAUL
                    smiling
               The eyes  yes yes saturation of the
               blood by the spice  melange Could the
               spice affect us in other ways

                         THUFIR
               Many dangers exist on Arrakis For one we
               know the Harkonnens would not have given
               up their CHOAM company contract so easily

                          PAUL
                    rising
               The Harkonnens are our enemies yes but
               behind them I suspect is the Emperor

                         THUFIR
               You will make a formidable Duke

     Paul bows

                     THUFIR CONTD
               Now remember the first step in avoiding
               a trap is knowing of its existence

                          PAUL
               I know  But if it is a trap then why are
               we going

                         THUFIR
               We have our new army
                    in the same breath
               Dr Yueh put the weirding module on him

     Thufir noticing a SQUAD OF GUARDS at the other end
     of the training room calls out to them

                     THUFIR CONTD
               Clear and lock the room

     Gurney activates a series of locks  LIGHTS GLOWS

     Suddenly a FIGHTER ROBOT lowers from the ceiling
     As the robot begins to rotate and go through several
     frightening complicated movements Dr Yueh places
     a plastic device around Pauls neck  He tightens it
     around the Adams apple above Pauls voice box
     Paul turns and emits a very strange powerful sound
     through the weirding module as he rushes towards the
     robot

     In front of a huge steam boiler the cable car stops
     and Piter gets out steps down steel stairs and
     enters a porcelain room where the Baron is being
     treated by a DOCTOR for sores on his face and body
     The doctor uses a lasbeam on a big sore on the
     Barons lips The Baron is sickly and hugely fat and
     sweaty and looks like he has been sickly for some
     time He turns to Piter as he enters the room

               entire Landsraad would turn against the
               Baron and the Emperor

                         DOCTOR
               Put the pick in there Pete
               And turn it round real neat

     His assistant does so

     Rabban breaks open a squood living food  The
     squood makes a tiny SCREAM then Rabban drinks the
     blood and bodily fluids  He throws the empty
     container of tiny animal meat into the dark water
     trough running through the center of the room
     Across the room TWO HARKONNEN SOLDIERS enter
     holding big guns on a BOY who is wearing white
     pants  The Baron smiles when he sees the boy who
     is deeply afraid  The guards force the boy to
     arrange violet flowers on a stand by the far wall
     opposite the Baron

                          BARON

               who controls the Spice controls the
               universe and what Piter didnt tell you
               is we have control of someone who is very
               close to Duke Leto  This person this
               traitor will be worth more to us than
               ten legions of Sardaukar

                          FEYD
               Who is the traitor

               I wont tell you who the traitor is or
               when well attack  However the Duke will
               die before these eyes and hell know that
               it is I  Baron Vladimir Harkonnen  who
               encompasses his doom

     The Baron gives a hand signal and seven gates in the
     wall open emitting tremendous SOUNDS  Suddenly the
     Baron begins to float straight up twentyfive feet
     in the air  It is a frightening sight  He floats
     down under the giant humming electrical tube light
     and rubs his head and body with a black fluid which
     drips from tiny holes in either side of the pink
     glow  Feyd and Rabban watch nervously  The
     Attendants stand completely still with fear

     The Baron swoops down to the Boy who stands
     petrified  The Harkonnen guards smile nervously as
     they step slightly backwards  The boy begins
     SCREAMING as the Baron pulls the boys heart plug
     located in his chest  The violet flowers are bumped
     and disarrayed by the violence which ensues  Then
     the Baron turns smiling to Feyd as the SOUNDS

     layered miniature replica of the entire Universe
     The Navigator emits a long piece of light from his

     Navigator turns and emits another piece of light
     which travels to the opposite side of the Universe

 INT ENTRANCE  SIETCH TABR  NIGHT

     The Fremen troop enters into a large square room
     with slot passageways going off in various
     directions

 INT PASSAGEWAY  SIETCH TABR  NIGHT

     They all move down one of the passageways which are
     beautifully but very plainly cut with lasguns  They
     are like passages in the pyramids dark with sharp
     turns and inclines upwards or downwards some very
     steep and long and others descending hundreds of
     feet  There is a strong moaning WIND

     Down a long sloping narrow passageway they go
     until they reach a stairway cut into the stone  It
     is very dark and gets increasingly darker as they
     descend  The WIND sound grows  The air grows
     colder and damper  Paul and Jessica share another
     questioning look  At the bottom of the stairs they
     pass through a narrow slot doorway which suddenly
     opens out on something so totally unexpected it
     shocks Paul

     A Fedaykin stand forward and recites from the
     prophecy

                       FEDAYKIN 
               and his word shall carry death eternal
               to those who stand against the righteous

     Feyd hears this and is angered

                          FEYD
               The righteous

                          PAUL
                    to Emperor
               There is a Harkonnen among you  Give the
               Harkonnen a blade and let him stand forth

                         EMPEROR
               If Feyd wishes he can meet you with my
               blade in his hand

                          FEYD
               I wish it
                    steps forward

                         GURNEY
               This is a Harkonnen animal  Let me
               please my Lord

                          PAUL
               The Emperors blade

     Feyd takes up the Emperors blade with a smile
     Paul takes out his crysknife  They begin to circle
     each other

     Paul smiles circling still  Suddenly Feyd leaps
     his blade jabbing savagely outward but Paul easily
     evades it moving away  They begin to circle again

     He makes another pass at Paul that comes dangerously
     close but again Paul is away a frozen smile on
     his face

                          FEYD
               Why prolong the inevitable  I will kill
               you  I will kill him

     Feyd smiles  He lashes out biting Pauls hand
     Feyd LAUGHS in triumph

     Feyd leaps forward jabbing his right hip also
     forward  Yet Paul although a little slowly again
     reels away  Again Feyd thrusts

     This time Paul jabs with his crysknife but Feyd
     moves away effortlessly  Feyd counters and kicks
     Paul to the ground

                          CHANI
               Paul

     Paul is up instantly and he circles with Feyd

                          FEYD
                    smiling
               Who is the little one  A pet perhaps
               Will she deserve my special attentions

     Paul jabs out his crysknife slashing  Feyd grabs
     his arm and Paul his the two men locked in a
     straining clinch  Feyd presses his right hip closer
     and closer to Pauls body  Paul strains to keep it
     away  Suddenly the gom jabbar flips out of Feyds
     girdle but on the left side and he lunges
     powerfully with it at Paul who just barely misses
     taking it in his skin  He throws Feyd back but not
     before Feyds feet strike out sending Paul to the
     floor  Feyd leaps onto him

                          FEYD
                    whispering
               You see your death my blade will
               finish you

     Suddenly Paul with lightning swiftness pushes
     Feyd up and over  He is on top of him in a flash

     Pauls crysknife flashes up thrusting upward
     through Feyds jaw  Feyds mouth opens as the knife
     continues up through his tongue and through to his
     brain  Feyds eyes go wild then glaze over as he
     jerks dead on the floor  Paul slowly gets to his
     feet breathing heavily  Anger still seething in
     him Paul issues a SOUND  a loud horrible
     powerful sound and Feyds internal organs rupture
     and the stone floor under him cracks open  The
     Fedaykin smile

                       FEDAYKIN 
               Usul no longer needs the weirding module

     Everyone stares in disbelief  Paul looks to the
     Emperor

                          PAUL
               Now I will tell you how it will be
               Irulan shall be my wife opening the way
               for an Atreides to take the throne

                         EMPEROR
               I sit on the throne

                          PAUL
               You will sit on a throne on Selusa
               Secundus your prison planet  Either that
               or you will die

     The Emperor is still  Paul moves to Chani

                      PAUL CONTD
                    to Chani
               The Princess shall have no more of me than
               my name no child of mine or touch the
               softness of glance nor instant of
               desire  This is my promise to you
                    whispering
               my love

     Paul turns back to the others

     Jessica turns to Chani and whispers to her

                         JESSICA
               Think on it Chani We who carry the name
               of concubine history will call us
               wives

     Alia enters with two monks  She signals and one of
     them places a cloak over Pauls shoulders

                          PAUL
               The Fremen have the word of Muaddib
               They will have their Holy War to cleanse
               the Universe they will have Arrakis
               Dune their planet  There will be
               flowing water here open to the sky and
               rich green oases  For the spice there
               will always be some desert  There will be
               fierce winds and trials to toughen men
               We Fremen have a saying
                    he stares at the Reverend Mother
               God created Arrakis to train the
               faithful
               One cannot go against the word of God

     Everyone in the room stares at him soundlessly

                          ALIA
               And how can this be

     There are three powerful drum hits

                      ALIA CONTD
               For he is the Kwisatz Haderach

 EXT ARRAKEEN PALACE  DUSK

     Paul opens his mouth and issues an ever increasing
     wind  Lightning and thunder begin  Clouds begin to
     form over the Palace  In the halflight of dusk
     thousands of Fremen watch the sky  Giant golden
     lights are illuminated and their rays shoot far into
     the sky illuminating the growing clouds  Five
     tremendous bolts of lightning suddenly unleash a
     downpour of RAIN ON ARRAKIS  The Fremen stand
     awestruck as they are drenched with water falling
     from the sky

 INT GREAT HALL  ARRAKEEN PALACE  DAY

     WE MOVE through Pauls glowing blue eyes into
     beautiful blue luminescent light

     A gigantic WIND arises and suddenly appearing in
     the blue light is an ocean of light rolling like
     gold glass off into infinite  The blue becomes
     darker and a golden lotus flower blooms in the
     night

                         THE END
