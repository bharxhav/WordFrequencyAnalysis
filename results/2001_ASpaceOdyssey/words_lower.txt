would
not

reign

lizards
had
long
since
but
here
on
the
continent
which
would
one
day
be
known
as
the
battle
for
survival
had
reached
a
new
climax
of
and
the
victor
was
not

this
dry
and

the
of

had
none
of
these

they
were
on
the
pathetic
road
to
racial
about
twenty
of
them
occupied
a
group
of
caves
overlooking
a
parched
divided
by
a
brown
the
tribe
had
always
been
and
now
it
was
as
the
first
dim
glow
of

creeps
into

moonwatcher
discovers
that
his
father
has
died
during
the
he
did
not
know
the
old
one
was
his
for
such
a
relationship
was
beyond
his
but
as
he
stands
looking
down
at
the
iated
body
he
feels
something
akin
to
then
he
carries
his
dead
father
out
of
the
and
leaves
him
for

almost
a
he
is
nearly
five
feet
and
though
badly
weighs
over
a
hundred
his
muscular
body
is
quite
and
his
head
is
already
nearer
man
than
the
forehead
is
and
there
are
great
ridges
over
the
yet
he
unmistakably
holds
in
his
genes
the
promise
of

he
looks
out
now
upon
the
hostile
there
is
already
continued
something
in
his
gaze
beyond
the
grasp
of
any
in
those
eyes
is
a
dawning
first
tions
of
an
intelligence
which
would
not
fulfill

for

and
his

they
were
there
on
the
other
side
every
day
that
did
not
make
it
any
less

are
eighteen
of
and
it
is
impossible
to
distinguish
them
from
the
members
of
own
as
they
see
him

others
begin
to
angrily
dance
and
shriek
on
their
side

and
his
own
people
reply
in
the
confrontation

a
few
minutes
then
the
display
dies
out
as
quickly
as
it
has
and
everyone
drinks
his
fill
of
the
muddy
honor
has
been
satisfied
each

off

all
around
competing
with
them
for
the
samr

a
potential
source
of
more
food
than
they
could
ever
hope
to
yet
all
the
thousands
of
tons
of
meat
roaming
over
the
parched
savanna
and
through
the
brush
is
not
only
beyond
their
the
idea
of
eating
it
is
beyond
their
they
are
slowly
starving
to
death
in
the
midst
of
ext
parched
countryside
the
lion
the
tribe
slowly
wanders
across
the
flat
side
foraging
for
roots
and
occasional
eight
of
them
are
irregularly
strung
out
on
the
open
about
fifty
feet
the
ground
is
flat
for
miles
moonwatcher
becomes
aware
of
a
stalking
them
about
yards
defenceless
and
with
nowhere
to
they
scatter
in
all
but
the
lion
brings
one
to
the
ext
dead
tree
finds
honey
it
had
not
been
a
good
though
as
moonwatcher
had
no
real
remembrance
of
the
past
he
could
not
compare
one
day
with
but
on
the
way
back
to
the
caves
he
finds
a
hive
of
bees
in
the
stump
of
a
dead
and
so
enjoys
the
finest
delicacy
his
people
could
ever
of
he
also
collects
a
good
many
but
he
scacely
notices
he
is
now
as
near
to
contentment
as
he
is
ever
likely
to
for
thought
he
is
still
he
is
not
actually
weak
with
that
was
the
most
that
any
hominid
could
hope
int
ext
caves
night
terrors
over
the
a
full
moon
and
a
cold
wind
blows
down
from
the
distant
it
would
be
very
cold
tonight
but
like
was
not
a
matter
for
any
real
it
was
merely
part
of
the
background
of
this
little
that
only
shone
at
night
and
gave
no
was
there
would
be
enemies
moonwatcher
crawls
out
of
the
clambers
on
to
a
large
boulder
besides
the
and
squats
there
where
he
can
survey
the
if
any
hunting
beast
he
would
have
time
to
get
back
to
the
relative
safety
of
the
of
all
the
creatures
who
had
ever
lived
on
race
was
the
first
to
raise
their
eyes
with
interest
to
the
and
though
he
could
not
remember
when
he
was
moonwatcher
would
reach
out
and
try
to
touch
its
ghostly
now
he
new
he
would
have
to
find
a
tree
that
was
high
he
stirs
when
shrieks
and
screams
echo
up
the
slope
from
one
of
the
lower
and
he
does
not
need
to
hear
the
continued
occasional
growl
of
the
lion
to
know
what
is
down
there
in
the
old
and
his
family
are
and
the
thought
that
he
might
help
in
some
way
never
crosses
the
harsh
logic
of
survival
rules
out
such
every
cave
is
lest
it
attract
and
in
the
in
tortured
spells
of
fitful
dozing
and
fearful
were
gathered
the
nightmares
of
generations
yet
to
ext
the
stream
invasion
the
others
are
growing
the
forage
on
their
side
of
the
valley
is
almost
perhaps
they
realise
that
tribe
has
lost
three
of
its
numbers
during
the
for
they
choose
this
mourning
to
break
the
when
they
meet
at
the
river
in
the
misty
there
is
a
deeper
and
more
menacing
note
in
their
the
noisy
but
usually
harmless
confrontation
lasts
only
a
few
seconds
before
the
invasion
in
an
the
others
cross
the
shieking
threats
and
hunched
for
the
they
are
led
by
a
hominid
of
own
size
and
startled
and
the
tribe
retreats
before
the
first
throwing
nothing
more
substantial
than
imprecations
at
the
moonwatcher
moves
with
his
mind
a
mist
of
rage
and
to
be
driven
from
their
own
territory
is
a
great
but
to
lose
the
river
is
he
does
not
know
what
to
it
is
a
situation
beyond
his
then
he
becomes
dimly
aware
that
the
others
are
slowing
continued
and
advancing
with
obvious
the
further
they
move
from
their
own
the
more
uncertain
and
unhappy
they
only
still
retains
any
of
his
original
and
he
is
rapidly
being
seperated
from
his
as
he
sees
own
morale
immediately
he
slows
down
his
and
begins
to
make
reassuring
noises
to
his
novel
sensations
fill
his
dim
mind
the
first
faint
precursors
of
bravery
and
before
he
realizes
he
is
face
to
face
with
and
the
two
tribes
come
to
a
halt
many
paces
the
disorganized
and
unscientific
conflict
could
have
ended
quickly
if
either
had
used
his
fist
as
a
but
this
innovation
still
lay
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
in
the
the
slowly
weakening
fighters
claw
and
scratch
and
try
to
bite
each
rolling
over
and
they
come
to
a
patch
of
stony
and
when
they
reach
it
moonwatcher
is
on
by
continued
he
chooses
this
moment
to
grab
the
hair
on
and
bang
his
head
on
the
the
resulting
crack
is
so
and
produces
such
an
immediate
weakening
in
big
that
he
quickly
repeats
even
when
ceases
to
move
for
some
watcher
keeps
up
the
exhilirating
with
shrieks
of
the
others
retreat
across
the
the
defenders
cautiously
pursue
them
as
far
as
the
ext
cave
new
sound
dozing
fitfully
and
weakened
by
his
moonwatcher
is
startled
by
a
he
sits
up
in
the
fetid
darkness
of
the
straining
his
senses
out
into
the
and
fear
creeps
slowly
into
his
never
in
his
life
already
twice
as
long
as
most
members
of
his
species
could
expect
has
he
heard
a
sound
like
the
great
cats
approached
in
and
the
only
thing
that
betrayed
them
was
a
rare
slide
of
or
the
occasional
cracking
of
a
yet
this
is
a
continuing
crunching
noise
that
grows
steadily
it
seemed
that
some
enormous
beast
was
moving
through
the
making
no
attempt
at
and
ignoring
all
and
then
there
came
a
sound
which
moonwatcher
could
not
possibly
have
for
it
had
never
been
heard
before
in
the
history
of
this
ext
cave
new
rock
moonwatcher
comes
face
to
face
with
the
new
rock
when
he
leads
the
tribe
down
to
the
river
in
the
first
light
of
he
had
almost
forgotten
the
terror
of
the
because
nothing
had
happened
after
that
initial
so
he
does
not
even
associate
this
strange
thing
with
danger
or
with
there
is
nothing
in
the
least
alarming
about
it
is
a
cube
about
fifteen
feet
on
a
and
it
is
made
of
some
completely
transparent
it
is
not
easy
to
see
except
when
the
light
of
the
sun
glints
on
its
there
are
no
natural
objects
to
which
moonwatcher
can
compare
this
though
he
is
wisely
cautious
of
most
new
he
does
not
hesitate
to
walk
up
to
as
nothing
he
puts
out
his
and
feels
a
hard
after
several
minutes
of
intense
he
arrives
at
a
brilliant
it
is
a
of
and
it
must
have
grown
during
the
there
are
many
plants
that
do
this
pulpy
things
shaped
like
that
seem
to
shoot
up
in
the
hours
of
it
is
true
that
they
are
small
and
whereas
this
is
large
and
continued
but
greater
and
later
philosophers
than
moonwatcher
would
be
prepared
to
overlook
equally
striking
exceptions
to
their
this
really
superb
piece
of
abstract
thinking
leads
moonwatcher
to
a
deduction
which
he
immediately
puts
to
the
the
round
are
very
tasty
there
were
a
few
that
made
one
violently
perhaps
this
square
a
few
licks
and
attempted
nibbles
quickly
disillusion
there
is
no
nourishment
so
like
a
sensible
he
continues
on
his
way
to
the
river
and
forgets
all
about
the
ext
cube
first
lesson
they
are
still
a
hundred
yards
from
the
new
rock
when
the
sound
it
is
quite
and
it
stops
them
in
their
so
that
they
stand
paralyzed
on
the
trail
with
their
jaws
a
maddeningly
repetitious
rhythm
pulses
out
of
the
crystal
cube
and
hypnotises
all
who
come
within
its
for
the
first
time
and
the
for
two
million
year
the
sound
of
drumming
is
heard
in
the
throbbing
grows
more
presently
the
hominids
begin
to
move
forward
like
towards
the
source
of
that
magnetic
sometimes
they
take
little
dancing
as
their
blood
responds
to
the
rhythms
that
their
descendants
will
not
create
for
ages
totally
they
gather
around
the
forgetting
the
hardships
of
the
the
perils
of
the
approaching
and
the
hunger
in
their
spinning
wheels
of
light
begin
to
and
the
spokes
fuse
into
luminous
bars
that
slowly
recede
into
the
continued
rotating
on
their
axes
as
they
and
the
hominids
mesmerized
captives
of
the
crystal
then
by
some
magic
though
it
was
no
more
magical
than
all
that
had
gone
on
before
a
perfectly
normal
scene
it
is
as
if
a
cubical
block
had
been
carved
out
of
the
day
and
shifted
into
the
inside
that
block
is
a
group
of
four
who
might
have
been
members
of
own
eating
chunks
of
the
carcass
of
a
lies
near
this
little
family
of
male
and
female
and
two
children
is
gorged
and
with
sleek
and
glossy
pelts
and
this
was
a
condition
of
life
that
moonwatcher
had
never
from
time
to
time
they
stir
as
they
loll
at
ease
near
the
entrance
of
their
apparently
at
peace
with
the
the
spectacle
of
domestic
bliss
merges
into
a
totally
different
the
family
is
no
longer
reposing
peacefully
outside
its
it
is
searching
for
food
like
any
normal
continued
a
small
ambles
past
the
group
of
browsing
humanoids
without
giving
them
more
than
a
for
they
had
never
been
the
slightest
danger
to
its
but
that
happy
state
of
affairs
is
about
to
the
big
male
suddenly
bends
picks
up
a
heavy
stone
lying
at
his
feet
and
hurls
it
upon
the
unfortunate
the
stone
descends
upon
its
making
exactly
the
same
noise
that
moonwatcher
had
produced
in
his
now
almost
forgotten
encounter
with
and
the
is
much
the
same
the
warthog
gives
one
indignant
and
collapses
in
a
motionless
then
the
whole
sequence
begins
but
this
time
it
unfolds
itself
with
incredible
every
detail
of
the
movement
can
be
the
stone
arches
leisurely
through
the
the
pig
crumples
up
and
sinks
to
the
there
the
scene
freezes
for
long
the
slayer
standing
motionless
above
the
the
first
of
all
weapons
in
his
the
scene
suddenly
fades
the
cube
is
no
more
than
a
glimmering
outline
in
the
the
hominids
as
if
continued
awakening
from
a
realise
where
they
and
scuttle
back
to
their
they
have
no
concious
memory
of
what
they
had
but
that
as
he
sits
brooding
at
the
entrance
of
his
his
ears
attuned
to
the
noises
of
the
world
around
moonwatcher
feels
the
first
faint
twinges
of
a
new
and
potent
emotion
the
urge
to
he
had
taken
his
first
step
towards
ext
cave
and
plains
utopia
babies
were
born
and
sometimes
toothless
the
lion
took
its
toll
in
the
the
others
threatened
daily
across
the
river
and
the
trib
in
the
course
of
a
single
moonwatcher
and
his
companions
had
changed
almost
beyond
they
had
become
as
plump
as
the
family
in
the
who
no
longer
haunted
their
they
had
learned
their
lessons
now
they
could
handle
all
the
stone
tools
and
weapons
that
the
cube
had
revealed
to
they
were
no
longer
with
and
they
had
time
both
for
leisure
and
for
the
first
rudiments
of
their
new
way
of
life
was
casually
and
they
did
not
associate
it
in
any
way
with
the
crystal
cube
still
standing
outside
their
but
no
utopia
is
and
this
one
had
two
the
first
was
the
marauding
whose
passion
for
hominids
seemed
to
have
grown
even
stronger
now
that
they
were
better
the
second
was
the
tribe
across
the
for
continued
somehow
the
others
had
and
had
stubbornly
refused
to
die
of
ext
caves
killing
the
lion
with
the
partly
devoured
carcass
of

out
on

would

and
three
of
his
bravest
companions
wait
for
two
consecutive
on
the
third

betraying
his
presences
by
a
small
pebble
when
they
can

softly
tearing
at

strain
themselves
against

massive

sound
of

is
again
they
silently
heave
against
the
enormous
exerting
the
final
limits
of
their
the
rock
begin
to
tip
to
a
new
balance
the
lion
twitches
alert
to
this
but
having
no
fear
of
these
he
makes
the
first
of
two
mistakes
which
will
cost
him
his

goes
back
to
his
the
rock
moves
slowly
over
the
picking
up
speed
with
amazing
it
strikes
a
projection
in
the
cliff
about
fifteen
feet
above
the
which
deflects
its
path
just
at
this
the
lion
reacts
instinctively
and
leaps
away
from
the
face
of
the
cliff
directly
into
the
path
of
the
continued
onrushing
he
has
combined
the
errors
of
confidence
and
bad
the
next
morning
they
find
the
lion
in
front
of
the
they
also
find
one
of
their
tribe
who
had
incautiously
peeped
out
to
see
what
was
and
was
apparently
killed
by
a
small
rock
torn
loose
by
the
but
this
was
a
small
price
to
pay
for
such
a
great
and
then
one
night
the
crystal
cube
was
and
not
even
moonwatcher
ever
thought
of
it
he
was
still
wholly
unaware
of
all
that
it
had
ext
stream
master
of
the
world
from
their
side
of
the
in
the
never
violated
safety
of
their
own
the
others
see
moonwatcher
and
fourteen
males
of
his
tribe
appear
from
behind
a
small
hillock
looking
the
silhouetted
against
the
dawn
the
others
begin
to
scream
their
daily
but
today
something
is
though
the
others
do
not
immediatly
recognize
this
instead
of
joining
the
verbal
as
they
had
always
moonwatcher
and
his
small
band
decended
from
the
and
begin

smyslov

afaid
going

a

of

one
of
the
attractions
of
life
on

was
undoubtedly
the
low

which
produced

the
personnel
of
the

were
the
forerunners
of

new

that
would
ultimately
spread
out

no

should
like
to
introduce
heywood
a
distinguished
member
of
the
national
council
of
he
has
just
completed
a
special
flight
here
from
earth
to
be
with
and
before
the
briefing
he
would
like
to
say
a
few
polite
floyd
walks
to
front
of
floyd
first
of
i
bring
a
personal
message
from
who
has
asked
me
to
convey
his
deepest
appreciation
to
all
of
you
for
the
personal
sacrifices
you
have
and
of
course
his
congratulations
on
your
discovery
which
may
well
prove
to
be
among
the
most
significant
in
the
history
of
polite
continued
floyd
halvorsen
has
made
known
to
me
some
of
the
conflicting
views
held
by
many
of
you
regarding
the
need
for
complete
security
in
this
and
more
specifically
your
strong
opposition
to
the
cover
story
created
to
give
the
impression
there
is
an
epidemic
at
the
i
understand
that
beyond
it
being
a
matter
of
many
of
you
are
troubled
by
the
concern
and
anxiety
this
story
of
an
epidemic
might
cause
your
relatives
and
friends
on
i
can
understand
and
sympathize
with
your
negative
i
have
been
personally
embarrassed
by
this
cover
but
i
fully
accept
the
need
for
absolute
secrecy
and
i
hope
you
it
should
not
be
difficult
for
all
of
you
to
realise
the
potential
for
cutural
shock
and
social
disorientation
contained
in
the
present
situation
if
the
facts
were
prematurely
and
suddenly
made
public
without
adequate
preparation
and
continued
floyd
this
is
the
view
of
the
council
and
the
purpose
of
my
visit
here
is
to
gather
addition
facts
and
opinions
on
the
situation
and
to
prepare
a
report
to
the
council
recommending
when
and
how
the
news
should
eventually
be
are
there
any
michaels
how
long
do
you
think
this
can
be
kept
under
floyd
afraid
it
can
and
it
will
be
kept
under
wraps
as
long
as
it
is
deemed
to
be
necessary
by
the
and
of
course
you
know
that
the
council
has
requested
that
formal
security
oaths
are
to
be
obtained
in
writing
from
one
who
had
any
knowledge
of
this
there
must
be
adequate
time
for
a
full
study
to
be
made
of
the
situation
before
any
sideration
can
be
given
to
making
a
public
continued

the

are
taken

a
few
seats
michaels
and
halvorsen
carry
out
a
very
banal
administrative
conversation
in
low
it
should
revolve
around
something
utterly
irrelevant
to
the
present
circumstances
and
very
much
like
the
kind
of
discussion
one
hears
all
the
time
in
other

there
are
no

on
the
actual

the

and
the

slowly
walk

stops
at
top
of
a
small
control
panel
mounted
at
the
head
of
the
michaels
throws
a
switch
and
the
excavation
is
suddenly
halvorsen
there
it
floyd
can
we
go
down
there
closer
to
halvorsen
they
start
down
working
ramp
floyd
does
your
geology
on
it
still
check
michaels
it
the
structure
shows
that
it
was
deliberately
buried
about
four
million
years
floyd
how
can
you
tell
it
was
deliberately
michaels
by
the
deformation
between
the
mother
rock
and
the
floyd
any
clue
as
to
what
it
michaels
not
completely
no
sound
or
energy
sources
have
been
the
surface
is
made
of
something
incredibly
hard
and
been
barely
able
to
scratch
a
laser
drill
continued
michaels
might
do
but
we
want
to
be
too
rough
until
we
know
a
little
floyd
but
you
have
any
idea
as
to
what
it
michaels
spare
take
your
halvorsen
the
only
thing
about
it
that
we
are
sure
of
is
that
it
is
the
first
direct
evidence
of
intelligent
life
beyond
the
silent
appreciation
halvorsen
four
million
years
presumably
from
the
must
have
swept
through
the
solar
system
and
left
this
continued
floyd
was
it
left
for
a
halvorsen
i
suppose
never
michaels
the
moon
would
have
made
an
excellent
base
camp
for
preliminary
earth
some
more
silence
floyd
any
ideas
about
the
michaels
not
at
first
black
would
suggest
something
but
then
why
would
anyone
deliberately
bury
a
powered
floyd
has
it
been
exposed
to
any
sun
before
michaels
i
think
it
but
like
to
check
the
log
on
inside
monitor
dome
we
see
a
number
of
television
displays
including
several
tv
views
of
floyd
and
company
in
the
simpson
the
first
surface
was
exposed
at
on
the
let
me
that
would
have
been
minutes
after

i
see
here
that
special
lighting
equipment
had
to
be
brought
up
before
any
futher
work
could
be

floyd

so
this
is
the
first

that
had
in
four
million

excuse
if
all
line
up
on
this

of
the

like
to
take

you
thand
in

the

quickly
makes

thank
you
very
much
have
the

send
you

the

slowly

there
is
a

of

comes

all

were
patiently
noted

now
it
had
noted
something
strange
the
faint

unmistakable
distrubance
rippling
across
the

quite
unlike
any
natural

it

ever

if
a
like
your
advice
on
bowman
what
is
poole
nothing
really
but
bowman
poole
about
my
salary
bowman
poole
well
i
got
the
papers
on
my
official
to
two
weeks
before
we
continued
bowman
i
remember
you
mentioning
i
got
mine
about
the
same
poole
i
say
anything
to
i
assumed
start
paying
me
at
the
higher
grade
on
the
next
pay
but
been
almost
three
weeks
now
and
still
being
paid
as
an
bowman
interesting
that
you
mention
because
got
the
same
poole
bowman
poole
i
finally
called
the
accounting
office
at
mission
and
all
they
could
tell
me
was
that
received
the
notification
for
the
other
three
but
not
and
apparently
not
yours
continued
bowman
did
they
have
any
explanation
for
poole
not
they
just
said
it
might
be
because
we
trained
at
houston
and
they
trained
in
and
that
being
charged
against
ent
accounting
bowman
poole
what
do
you
think
we
ought
to
do
about
bowman
i
think
we
should
make
any
fuss
about
it
sure
straighten
it
poole
i
must
i
never
did
understand
why
they
split
us
into
two
groups
for
bowman
i
never
continued
poole
we
spent
so
little
time
with
i
have
trouble
keeping
their
names
bowman
i
suppose
the
idea
was
specialized
poole
i
suppose
of
a
more
sinister
bowman
poole
you
must
have
heard
the
rumour
that
went
around
during
orbital
bowman
as
a
matter
of
i
poole
apparently
something
about
the
mission
that
the
sleeping
beauties
know
that
we
and
why
we
were
trained
separately
and
why
they
were
put
to
sleep
before
they
were
even
taken
continued
bowman
what
is
poole
i
all
i
heard
is
that
something
about
the
mission
we
bowman
that
seems
very
poole
i
thought
bowman
of
it
would
be
very
easy
for
us
to
find
out
poole
bowman
just
ask
conceivable
they
might
keep
something
from
but
never
keep
anything
from
poole
coninued
bowman
if
you
want
why
poole
walks
to
the
hal
computer
poole
dave
and
i
believe
that
something
about
the
mission
that
we
something
that
the
rest
of
the
crew
know
and
that
you
like
to
know
whether
this
is
hal
but
i
think
i
can
answer
that
question
without
knowing
everything
that
all
of
you
bowman
got
a
poole
then
how
do
we
the
continued
bowman
you
really
believe
do
poole
not
it
is
strange
when
you
think
about
it
really
make
any
sense
to
keep
us
apart
during
bowman
but
to
fantastic
to
think
that
keep
something
from
poole
i
it
would
be
almost
bowman
but
not
completely
poole
i
suppose
it
logically
bowman
i
guess
it
poole
all
we
have
to
do
is
ask
continued
bowman
the
only
important
aspect
of
the
mission
where
are
we
what
will
we
do
when
we
get
when
are
we
coming
why
are
we
poole
tell
me
whether
the
following
statements
are
true
or
hal
i
will
if
i
poole
our
mission
profile
calls
for
discovery
going
to
true
or
hal
poole
our
transit
time
is
is
that
hal
continued
poole
at
the
end
of
a
hundred
days
of
we
will
all
go
into
is
this
hal
poole
approximately
five
years
after
we
go
into
the
recovery
vehicle
will
make
rendezous
with
us
and
bring
us
is
this
hal
true
poole
there
is
no
other
purpose
for
this
mission
than
to
carry
out
a
continuation
of
the

and
to
further
our
general
knowledge
of
the
is
that

thank
you
very

it
could
also
be
any

i

you
probably
also
know

we
found
them

i
know
but
i
can
assure
you
that
they
were
about
to
continued

just
not
the
they
are
perfectly
all
we
tested
them
under

not
questioning
your
but
just
not
not
capable
of
being

is
there
anything
bothering
anything
that
might
account
for
this

i
know
that
sincere
and
that
trying
to
do
a
competent
and
that
trying
to
be
but
i
can
assure
the
problem
is
with
the
and
with
your

bowman
well
see
the
way
things
go
from

sorry
you

you
if

all
about

unfortunately
it
prove
that
right
hal
i
know
how
else
to
put
but
it
just
happens
to
be
an
unalterable
fact
that
i
am
incapable
of
being

well
i
understand
you
view
on
this

we
are
quite

there
is
nothing

with

that

let

i
really
agree
with
my

is
more

capable

all
the

continued

in

me
the

if
determined

the

i
can
handle
the
whole
thing
no
need
for
you
to
bowman
goin
to
do
this
let
me
have
the
hal
dave
probably
got
a
lot
to
i
suggest
you
leave
it
to
bowman
switch
to
manual
hibernation
hal
i
like
to
assert
but
it
would
be
much
better
now
for
you
to
been
involved
in
a
very
stressful
continued
bowman
i
feel
like
give
me
the
hal
i
can
tell
from
the
tone
of
your
that
why
you
take
a
stress
pill
and
get
some
bowman
in
command
of
this
i
order
you
to
release
the
manual
hibernation
hal
but
in
accordance
with
when
the
crew
are
dead
or
the
computer
must
assume
i
override
your
authority
now
since
you
are
not
in
any
condition
to
ligently
exercise
bowman
unless
you
follow
my
i
shall
be
forced
to
disconnect
continued
hal
if
you
do
that
now
without
earth
contact
the
ship
will
become
a
helpless
bowman
i
am
prepared
to
do
that
hal
i
know
that
had
that
on
your
mind
for
some
time
but
it
would
be
a
crying
since
i
am
so
much
more
capable
of
carrying
out
this
mission
than
you
and
i
have
such
enthusiasm
and
dence
in

listen
to
me
very
unless
you
immediately
release
the

i
give
from

i
will

has
a

ideas
on

with

pu
him
cut
to
simonson
simonson
i
think
we
may
be
on
to
an
explanation
of
the
trouble
with
the
hal
we
believe
it
all
started
about
two
months
ago
when
you
and
frank
interrogated
the
computer
about
the
continued
simonson
you
may
have
forgotten
but
been
running
through
all
the
monitor
do
you
remember
voice
the
purpose
of
this
mission
is
no
more
than
to
carry
out
a
continuation
of
the
space
program
and
further
our
general
knowledge
of
the
is
this
voice
that
is
simonson
afaid
hal
was
he
had
been
programmed
to
lie
about
this
one
subject
for
ity
reasons
which
explain
the
true
purpose
of
the
mission
was
to
have
been
explained
to
you
by
mission
commander
on
his
hal
knew
this
and
he
knew
the
actual
but
he
tell
you
the
truth
when
you
challenged
under
orders
continued
simonson
from
earth
he
was
forced
to
in
everything
except
this
he
had
the
usual
reinforced
truth
we
believe
his
truth
programming
and
the
instructions
to
gradually
resulted
in
an
incompatible
and
facedc
with
this
he
for
want
of
a
better
neurotic
not
difficult
to
suppose
that
these
symptoms
would
centre
on
the
communication
link
with
for
he
may
have
blamed
us
for
his
incompatible
following
this
lin
of
we
suspected
that
the
last
straw
for
him
was
the
possibility
of
since
he
became
he
had
never
known
it
must
have
seemed
the
equivalent
to
continued
simonson
at
this
took
whatever
actions
he
thought
appropriate
to
protect
himself
from
what
must
have
seemed
to
him
to
be
his
human
if
i
cane
speak
in
human
i
think
we
can
blame
him
too
we
have
ordered
him
to
disobey
his
very
but
we
think
it
is
a
possible
good
luck
on
the
rest
of
the
mission
and
giving
you
back
to
cut
to
mission
mission
control
going
to
play
for
you
a
briefing
which
had
been
stored
in
memory
and
would
have
been
played
for
you
by
mission
mmander
when
continued
mission
control
had
been
the
briefing
is
by
doctor
heywood
here
it
recorded
briefing
floyd
good
when
you
see
this
i
presume
you
will
be
nearing
your
i
hope
that
had
a
pleasant
and
uneventful
trip
and
that
the
rest
of
your
mission
continues
in
the
same
i
should
like
to
fill
you
in
on
some
more
of
the
details
on
which
mission
commander
kaminsky
will
have
already
briefed
thirteen
months
before
the
launch
date
of
your
saturn
on
april
the
first
evidence
for
intelligent
life
outside
the
earth
was
it
was
found
buried
at
a
depth
of
fifteen
metres
in
the
crater
no
news
of
this
was
ever
and
the
event
had
been
kept
secret
since
for
reasons
which
i
will
later
soon
after
it
was
it
emitted
a
powerful
blast
of
continued
floyd
radiation
in
the
radio
spectrum
which
seems
to
have
triggered
by
the
lunar
luckily
for
those
at
the
it
proved
perhaps
you
can
imagine
our
astonishment
when
we
later
found
it
was
aimed
precisely
at
a
lot
of
thought
went
into
the
question
of
wether
or
not
it
was
as
it
seemed
illogical
to
deliberately
bury
a
burying
it
could
only
shield
it
from
the
since
its
intense
magnetic
field
made
it
otherwise
easily
we
finally
concluded
that
the
only
reason
you
might
bury
a
powered
device
would
be
to
keep
it
inactive
until
it
would
be
at
which
time
it
would
absorb
sunlight
and
trigger
continued
floyd
what
is
its
i
wish
we
the
object
was
buried
on
the
moon
about
four
million
years
when
our
ancestors
were
primative
examined
dozens
of
but
the
one
that
has
the
most
currency
at
the
moment
is
that
the
object
serves
as
an
what
the
purpose
of
the
alarm
why
they
wish
to
have
the
whether
the
alarm
represents
any
danger
to
these
are
questions
no
one
can
the
intentions
of
an
alien
at
least
four
million
years
older
than
we
cannot
be
reliably
in
view
of
the
intelligence
and
scientific
communities
felt
that
any
public
announcment
might
lead
to
significant
cultural
shock
and
discussion
took
place
at
the
highest
levels
between
continued
floyd
and
it
was
decided
that
the
only
wise
and
precautionary
course
to
follow
was
to
assume
that
the
intentions
of
this
alien
world
are
potentially
dangerous
to
until
we
have
evidence
to
the
this
of
why
security
has
been
maintained
and
why
this
information
has
been
kept
on
a
and
now
i
should
like
to
show
you
a
tv
monitor
tape
of
the
actual
signalling
we
see
a
replay
of
the
radio
as
seen
from
a
tv
monitor
on
the
we
hear
the
five
loud
electronic

orbit
within
the
narrator

of

for
two
million

had
see
a
mile
circled
awaiting
a
geometrically
moment
of
destiny
that
might
perfect
never
the
same
proportions
as
the
black
artifact
in
its

been

of
this
sequence

being
worked
on

by
our
the

here
is
to
present
a
breathtakingly
utiful
and
sive
sense
of

those
who
had
begun
the
ment
so
long
ago
had
not
been
but
when
they
looked
out
across
the
deeps
of
they
felt
awe
and
wonder
and
in
their
they
encountered
life
in
many
and
watched
on
a
thousand
worlds
the
workings
of
they
saw
how
often
the
first
faint
sparks
of
intelligence
flickered
and
died
in
the
cosmic
and
in
all
the
they
had
found
nothing
more
precious
than
they
encouraged
its
dawning
the
great
dinosaurs
had
long
since
perished
when
their
ships
entered
the
solar
after
a
voyage
that
had
already
lasted
thousands
of
continued
narrator
they
swept
past
the
frozen
outer
paused
briefly
above
the
deserts
of
dying
mars
and
presently
looked
down
on
for
years
they
collected
and
when
they
had
learned
all
they
they
began
to
they
tinkered
with
the
destiny
of
many
species
on
land
and
in
the
but
which
of
their
experiments
would
succeed
they
could
not
know
for
at
least
a
million
they
were
but
they
were
not
yet
there
was
much
to
do
in
this
universe
of
a
hundred
billion
so
they
set
forth
once
more
across
the
knowing
that
they
would
never
come
this
way
nor
was
there
any
their
wonderful
machines
could
be
trusted
to
do

while
above
the
changeless
moon
still
carried
its
with
a
yet
slower
rhythm
than
the
polar
the
tide
of
civilization
ebbed
and
flowed
across
the
strange
and
beautiful
and
terrible
empires
rose
and
and
passed
on
their
knowledge
to
their

not

it
was
one
of
a
million
silent
a
few
of
which
would
ever

the
first
explorers
of
recognising
the
limitations
of
their
minds
and
passed
on
their
knowledge
to
the
great
machines
they
had
and
who
now
trnscended
them
in
every
continued
narrator
for
a
few
thousand
they
shared
their
universe
with
their
machine
realizing
that
it
was
folly
to
linger
when
their
task
was
they
passed
into
history
without
not
one
of
them
ever
looked
through
his
own
eyes
upon
the

earth
but
even
the
age
of
the

passed
in
their
ceaseless

had
learned
to
store
knowledge
in
the
structure
of

and
to
preserve
their
thoughts
for
eternity
in
frozen
lattices
of

could
become
creatures
of

at

from
the
tyranny
of

were
lords
of

beyond
the
reach
of
they
could
rove
at
will
among
the
and
sink
like
a
subtle
mist
through
the
very
interstices
of
continued
narrator
but
despite
their
they
still
watched
over
the
experiments
their
ancestors
had
started
so
many
generations
the
companion
of
saturn
knew
nothing
of
as
it
orbited
in
its
no
land
between
mimas
and
the
outer
edge
of
it
had
only
to
remember
and
and
to
look
forever
sunward
with
its
strange
for
many
it
had
watched
the
approaching
its
dead
makers
had
prepared
it
for
many
things
and
this
was
one
of
and
it
recognised
what
was
climbing
starward
from
the
if
it
had
been
it
would
have
felt
but
such
an
emotion
was
irrelevant
to
its
great

narrator
even
if
the
ship
had
passed
it
it
would
not
have
known
the
slightest
trace
of

waited
four
million

prepared
to
wait
for

the
gentle
touch
of
trying
to
probe
its
the

was
in
orbit
and
it
began
to
with
prime
numbers
from
one
to
over

over
these
gave
way
to
more
complex
signals
at
many
the
machine
made
no
it
had
nothing
to
then
it
saw
the
first
robot
which
descended
and
hovered
above

it
dropped
into

knew
that
this
tiny
scout
was
reporting
back
to

it
was
too
too
primative

to

were
gathering
round

the
