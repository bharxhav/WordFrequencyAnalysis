bent
looking

at

just
stares
silently
at

are

do
is
teach
you
to
be
less
of
a

probably
never
let
you
go
wherever
that
would

the

is
not

the
question
is
whether

matters

it

initial
time
is
that
what

eventually
convinces

of

that

is

says
if
you
try
anything
lock
you
up
in
a
little
but
they
already
put
you
in
a

only
they
really
lock
it

even
guard
it
too
carefully

how
can

to
sit
in
your

room

live
in
your

collection
of
carefully
polishing

half

pinned
to

how
i
could
make
a
fast
or
such
and
such
is
the
key
to
eternal
the
miserable
for
a
few
the
secrets
of
the
universe
are
opened
to
life
is
a
cheap
parlor
but
then
the
the
has
to
hand
over
the
controls
to
the
next
guy
down
the
most
likely
the
guy
who
just
wants
to
eat
potato
and
insight
and
brilliance
and
salvation
are
all
entrusted
to
a
moron
or
a
hedonist
or
a
the
only
way
out
of
this
of
is
to
take
steps
to
ensure
that
you
control
the
idiots
that
you
to
take
your
chain
hand
in
and
lead
the
best
way
to
do
this
is
with
a
like
a
letter
you
write
to
a
master
drafted
by
the
guy
who
can
see
the
made
with
steps
simple
enough
for
the
rest
of
the
idiots
to
follow
steps
one
through
one
repeat
as
your
problem
is
a
little
more
but
fundamentally
the
same
like
that
computer
the
chinese
you
remember
one
guy
sits
in
a
little
laying
down
cards
with
letters
written
on
them
in
a
language
he
laying
them
down
one
letter
at
a
time
in
a
sequence
according
to
someone
the
cards
are
supposed
to
spell
out
a
joke
in
the
guy
speak
of
he
just
follows
his
there
are
some
obvious
differences
in
your
of
you
broke
out
of
the
room
they
had
you
so
the
whole
enterprise
has
to
be
and
the
guy
giving
the
just
an
earlier
version
of
and
the
joke
got
a
punch
i
just
think
going
to
find
it
very
so
the
all
you
have
to
do
is
follow
your
like
climbing
a
ladder
or
descending
a
one
step
at
a
right
down
the
and
the
of
to
any
list
is
to
keep
it
in
a
place
where
bound
to
see
he
can
hear
the
buzzing
through
his
he
reaches
out
for
the
alarm
but
he
move
his
earl
opens
his
eyes
to
see
a
large
man
bent
double
over
the
man
looks
up
at
then
resumes
his
earl
looks
around
too
dark
for
a
then
the
pain
floods
his
blocking
out
the
other
he
squirms
trying
to
yank
his
forearm
the
one
that
feels
like
the
arm
but
the
man
shoots
him
another
earl
adjusts
himself
in
the
chair
to
see
over
the
top
of
the
the
noise
and
the
pain
are
both
coming
from
a
gun
in
the
gun
with
a
needle
where
the
barrel
should
the
needle
is
digging
into
the
fleshy
underside
of
leaving
a
trail
of
puffy
letters
behind
earl
tries
to
rearrange
himself
to
get
a
better
to
read
the
letters
on
his
but
he
he
lies
back
and
stares
at
the
eventually
the
tattoo
artist
turns
off
the
wipes
forearm
with
a
piece
of
and
wanders
over
to
the
back
to
dig
up
a
pamphlet
describing
how
to
deal
with
a
possible
maybe
later
tell
his
wife
about
this
guy
and
his
little
maybe
his
wife
will
convince
him
to
call
the
earl
looks
down
at
the
the
letters
are
rising
up
from
the
weeping
a
they
run
from
just
behind
the
strap
of
watch
all
the
way
to
the
inside
of
his
earl
blinks
at
the
message
and
reads
it
it
in
careful
little
i
raped
and
killed
your
your
birthday
so
i
got
you
a
little
i
would
have
just
bought
you
a
but
who
knows
where
that
would
have
so
i
got
you
a
i
think
i
may
have
had
to
pawn
your
watch
to
buy
but
what
the
hell
did
you
need
a
watch
probably
asking
why
a
in
guessing
going
to
be
asking
yourself
that
question
every
time
you
find
it
in
your
too
many
of
these
letters
too
many
for
you
to
dig
back
into
every
time
you
want
to
know
the
answer
to
some
little
a
a
practical
but
think
of
it
this
not
really
laughing
at
you
so
much
as
with
like
to
think
that
every
time
you
take
it
out
of
your
pocket
and
why
do
i
have
this
a
little
part
of
a
little
piece
of
your
broken
will
remember
and
like
laughing
you
do
know
the
it
was
something
you
learned
so
if
you
think
about
back
in
the
old
people
were
obsessed
with
the
fear
of
being
buried
you
remember
medical
science
not
being
quite
what
it
is
it
uncommon
for
people
to
suddenly
wake
up
in
a
so
rich
folks
had
their
coffins
outfitted
with
breathing
little
tubes
running
up
to
the
mud
above
so
that
if
someone
woke
up
when
they
supposed
they
run
out
of
they
must
have
tested
this
out
and
realized
that
you
could
shout
yourself
hoarse
through
the
but
it
was
too
narrow
to
carry
much
not
enough
to
attract
at
so
a
string
was
run
up
the
tube
to
a
little
bell
attached
to
the
if
a
dead
person
came
back
to
all
he
had
to
do
was
ring
his
little
bell
till
someone
came
and
dug
him
up
laughing
picturing
you
on
a
bus
or
maybe
in
a
reaching
into
your
pocket
and
finding
your
little
bell
and
wondering
to
yourself
where
it
came
why
you
have
maybe
even
ring
happy
i
know
who
figured
out
the
solution
to
our
mutual
so
i
know
whether
to
congratulate
you
or
a
bit
of
a
lifestyle
but
an
elegant
look
to
yourself
for
the
that
sounds
like
something
out
of
a
hallmark
i
know
when
you
thought
it
but
my
off
to
not
that
you
know
what
the
hell
talking
a
real
after
everybody
else
needs
mirrors
to
remind
themselves
who
they
no
the
little
mechanical
voice
then
repeats
it
time
is
this
is
a
courtesy
earl
opens
his
eyes
and
replaces
the
the
phone
is
perched
on
a
cheap
veneer
headboard
that
stretches
behind
the
curves
to
meet
the
and
ends
at
the
the
tv
is
still
blobs
of
flesh
color
nattering
away
at
each
earl
lies
back
down
and
is
surprised
to
see
older
the
hair
pulling
away
from
his
head
like
solar
the
mirror
on
the
ceiling
is
the
silver
fading
earl
continues
to
stare
at
astonished
by
what
he
he
is
fully
but
the
clothes
are
threadbare
in
earl
feels
the
familiar
spot
on
his
left
wrist
for
his
but
he
looks
down
from
the
mirror
to
his
it
is
bare
and
the
skin
has
changed
to
an
even
as
if
he
never
owned
a
watch
in
the
first
the
skin
is
even
in
color
except
for
the
solid
black
arrow
on
the
inside
of
pointing
up
his
he
stares
at
the
arrow
for
a
perhaps
he
try
to
rub
it
off
he
rolls
up
his
the
arrow
points
to
a
sentence
tattooed
along
inner
earl
reads
the
sentence
maybe
another
arrow
picks
up
at
the
beginning
of
the
points
farther
up
disappearing
under
the
he
unbuttons
his
looking
down
on
his
he
can
make
out
the
shapes
but
cannot
bring
them
into
so
he
looks
up
at
the
mirror
above
the
arrow
leads
up
crosses
at
the
and
descends
onto
his
upper
terminating
at
a
picture
of
a
face
that
occupies
most
of
his
the
face
is
that
of
a
large
with
a
mustache
and
a
it
is
a
particular
but
like
a
police
sketch
it
has
a
certain
unreal
the
rest
of
his
upper
torso
is
covered
in
bits
of
and
all
of
them
written
backward
on
forward
in
the
eventuallyearl
sits
buttons
his
and
crosses
to
the
he
takes
out
a
pen
and
a
piece
of
notepaper
from
the
desk
and
begins
to
i
know
where
be
when
you
read
not
even
sure
if
bother
to
read
i
guess
you
need
a
that
you
and
i
will
never
like
the
song
the
time
you
read
this
be
so
close
the
way
it
so
many
pieces
put
spelled
i
guess
just
a
matter
of
time
until
you
find
who
knows
what
done
to
get
must
be
a
hell
of
a
if
only
you
could
remember
any
of
i
guess
better
that
you
i
had
a
thought
just
maybe
find
it
everybody
is
waiting
for
the
end
to
but
what
if
it
already
passed
us
what
if
the
final
joke
of
judgment
day
was
that
it
had
already
come
and
gone
and
we
were
none
the
apocalypse
arrives
the
chosen
are
herded
off
to
and
the
rest
of
the
ones
who
failed
the
just
keep
on
dead
wandering
around
long
after
the
gods
have
stopped
keeping
still
optimistic
about
the
i
guess
if
then
it
matter
what
you
no
if
you
find
then
it
because
nothing
and
if
you
do
find
then
you
can
kill
him
without
worrying
about
the
because
there
are
no
what
thinking
about
right
in
this
scrappy
little
framed
pictures
of
ships
on
the
i
but
if
i
had
to
say
somewhere
up
the
if
wondering
why
your
left
arm
is
five
shades
browner
than
your
i
know
what
to
tell
i
guess
we
must
have
been
driving
for
a
i
know
what
happened
to
your
and
all
these
i
have
no
not
a
one
that
i
car
keys
and
house
keys
and
the
little
fiddly
keys
for
what
have
we
been
up
i
wonder
if
feel
stupid
when
you
find
tracked
down
by
the
assassinated
by
a
be
gone
in
a
put
down
the
close
my
and
then
you
can
read
this
through
if
you
i
just
wanted
you
to
know
that
proud
of
no
one
who
matters
is
left
to
say
no
one
left
is
going
to
want
eyes
are
wide
staring
through
the
window
of
the
smiling
smiling
through
the
window
at
the
crowd
gathering
across
the
the
crowd
gathering
around
the
body
in
the
the
body
emptying
slowly
across
the
sidewalk
and
into
the
storm
a
stocky
eyes
balding
in
as
in
police
faces
tend
to
look
the
this
is
definitely
somebody
in
but
it
could
be
earl
is
still
smiling
at
the
body
as
the
car
pulls
away
from
the
the
to
maybe
a
police
maybe
just
a
as
the
car
is
swallowed
into
eyes
continue
to
shine
out
into
the
watching
the
body
until
it
disappears
into
a
circle
of
concerned
he
chuckles
to
himself
as
the
car
continues
to
make
distance
between
him
and
the
growing
smile
fades
a
something
has
occurred
to
he
begins
to
pat
down
his
leisurely
at
like
a
man
looking
for
his
then
a
little
more
maybe
his
progress
is
impeded
by
a
set
of
he
begins
to
empty
the
contents
of
his
pockets
out
onto
the
seat
next
to
some
a
bunch
of
scraps
of
a
round
metal
lump
rolls
out
of
his
pocket
and
slides
across
the
vinyl
earl
is
frantic
he
hammers
at
the
plastic
divider
between
him
and
the
begging
the
man
for
a
perhaps
the
cabbie
speak
much
perhaps
the
cop
in
the
habit
of
talking
to
either
the
divider
between
the
man
in
front
and
the
man
behind
remains
a
pen
is
not
the
car
hits
a
and
earl
blinks
at
his
reflection
in
the
rearview
he
is
calm
the
driver
makes
another
and
the
metal
lump
slides
back
over
to
rest
against
leg
with
a
little
he
picks
it
up
and
looks
at
curious
it
is
a
little
a
little
metal
inscribed
on
it
are
his
name
and
a
set
of
he
recognizes
the
first
the
year
in
which
he
was
but
the
second
date
means
nothing
to
nothing
at
as
he
turns
the
bell
over
in
his
he
notices
the
empty
space
on
his
wrist
where
his
watch
used
to
there
is
a
little
arrow
pointing
up
his
earl
looks
at
the
then
begins
to
roll
up
his
be
late
for
your
own
the
more
i
think
about
the
more
trite
that
what
kind
of
after
is
in
any
kind
of
rush
to
get
to
the
end
of
his
own
and
how
would
i
know
if
i
were
i
have
a
watch
i
know
what
we
did
with
what
the
hell
do
you
need
a
watch
it
was
an
deadweight
tugging
at
your
symbol
of
the
old
the
you
that
believed
in
scratch
not
so
much
that
lost
your
faith
in
time
as
that
time
has
lost
its
faith
in
and
who
needs
who
wants
to
be
one
of
those
saps
living
in
the
safety
of
the
in
the
safety
of
the
moment
after
the
moment
in
which
they
felt
something
living
in
the
next
in
which
they
feel
crawling
down
the
hands
of
the
away
from
the
people
who
did
unspeakable
things
to
believing
the
lie
that
time
will
heal
all
is
just
a
nice
way
of
saying
that
time
deadens
but
more
time
is
three
things
for
most
but
for
for
just
a
one
this
like
the
center
of
the
the
axis
on
which
the
hands
time
moves
about
you
but
never
moves
it
has
lost
its
ability
to
affect
what
is
it
they
that
time
is
but
not
for
close
your
eyes
and
you
can
start
all
over
conjure
up
that
necessary
fresh
as
time
is
an
an
the
only
thing
that
matters
is
this
this
moment
a
million
times
you
have
to
trust
if
this
moment
is
repeated
if
you
keep
you
have
to
keep
you
will
come
across
the
next
item
on
your
