drones
boringly
and
while
we
might
pick
up
a

are
the
music
to
which
the
image
after
a
moment
a
series
of
lines
cross
the
screen
and
the
image
diminishes
and
we
realise
we
are
looking
at
a
office
deckard
and
bryant
are
sitting
in
the
dark
looking
at
a
series
of
flickering
deckard
has
a

we
had
an
escape
from
the
off

colonies
two
weeks
six
three
three
slaughtered
twenty
three
people
and
jumped
a
an
aerial

these
are
old

show
me
something
the
naked
man
continues
to
exercise
as
bryant
bryant
no
sign
of
them
then
three
nights
ago
they
tried
to
break
into
the
tyrell
one
got
fried
going
through
an
but
we
lost
the
going
on
the
possibibility
they
might
try
to
infiltrate
as
we
sent
holden
in
to
run
voight
kampff
tests
on
new
guess
he
found
himself
the
screen
roy
batty
in
a

cloth
is
battering

why
would
they
come
down

bryant
you
tell
me
what
here
deckard
they
must
want
something
pretty
important
to
risk
coming
back
what
do
the
rest
look
like
bryant
pushes
a

a
series
of
revolving
still
shots
of

zhora
appear
on
the
deckard
why
the
tyrell
why
would
they
return
to
the
place
of
their
bryant
maybe
they
want
to
find
out
when
they
were
made
deckard
why
would
they
bryant
the
nexus
was
designed
to
copy
human
beings
in
every
way
except
their
but
the
makers
reckoned
that
after
a
few
years
they
might
develop
their
own
emotional
responses
so
they
built
in
a
fail
safe
deckard
bryant

coming
from
about
fifteen
feet
behind
the

from
within
the
deckard
after
a
short
as
if
the

hungrily
from

he
cleans
the

on
quite
a
show
no
doubt
about
with
a
flourish
he
brings
a
dirty
rag
out
of
his
pocket
and
starts
polishing
the
pointed
tip
of
his
long
black
gaff
you
think
a
wimp
he
waits
for
the
but
deckard
gaff
moistens
the
rag
with
his
tongue
and
applies
it
to
the
gaff
i
could
kill
you
right
now
so
you
better
say
deckard
is
got
all
the
seems
to
be
bristling
with
concealed
eyes
level
on
his
voice
comes
out
low
and
deckard
i
think
a
gaff
nods
like
he
knew
it
all
along
it
seems
to
please
gaff
i
admire
you
more
and
deckard
exhales
his
eyes
the
bullshit
is
gaff
smiles
like
a
puts
the
rag
back
in
his
gaff
i
guess
deckard
gaff
washed
wiped
he
cocks
his
head
like
a
bluejay
waiting
for
the
gaff
what
about
deckard
somewhere
far
away
a
whistle
then
deckard
he
is
moving
his
back
to
the
voice
follows
gaff
you
did
sure
you
he
his
hand
comes
out
of
his
pocket
with
a
gaff
hard
to
be
sure

keeps
gaff
deckard
slowly
gaff
shows
him
the
but

the
rejection
with
a
suck
on
his
gaff

soar
over
what
is
suddenly
a
vast
forest
spreading
to
enormous
voice
deckard
i
knew
it
on
the
roof
that
we
were
roy
batty
and
combat
models
of
the
highest
we
had
fought
in
wars
not
yet
dreamed
in
vast
nightmares
still
we
were
the
new
roy
and
me
and
we
were
made
for
this
it
was
trees
explode
past
us
in
a
rage
of
branches
as
we
dip
and
swerve
and
when
the
spinner
looms
into
view
zooming
right
at
then
tilting
and
yawing
off
in
hot
pursuit
with
gaff
at
the
credits
are
god
help
us
fade
the
end
