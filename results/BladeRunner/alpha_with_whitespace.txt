	   FADE IN

	   EXT HADES  DUSK

	   We are MOVING TOWARD the Tyrell Corporation across a
	   vast plain of industrialization menacing shapes on the
	   horizon stacks belching flames five hundred feet into
	   the sky the color of cigar ash  The CAMERA MOVES INTO
	   a window in the large pyramidshaped building  A man
	   is sitting at a table  Another man enters the room and
	   sits down  The following scene is reflected in the eye
	   until HOLDEN is seated


	   INT TYRELL CORPORATION INTERROGATION ROOM  DUSK

	   The eye is magnified and deeply revealed  Flecks of
	   green and yellow in a field of milky blue  Icy fila
	   ments surround the undulating center

	   The eye is brown in a tiny screen  On the metallic
	   surface below the words VOIGHTKAMPFF are finely
	   etched  Theres a touchlight panel across the top
	   and on the side of the screen a dial that registers
	   fluctuation of the iris

	   The instrument is no bigger than a music box and sits
	   on a table between two men  The man talking is big
	   looks like an overstuffed kid  LEON it says on his
	   breast pocket  Hes dressed in a warehousemans uni
	   form and his pudgy hands are folded expectantly in his
	   lap  Despite the obvious heat he looks very cool

	   The man facing him is lean hollowcheeked and dressed
	   in grey  Detached and efficient he looks like a cop
	   or an accountant  His name is Holden and hes all
	   business except for the sweat on his face

	   The room is large and humid  Rows of salvaged junk
	   are stacked neatly against the walls  Two large FANS
	   WHIRR above their heads

						  LEON
			   Okay if I talk

	   Holden doesnt answer  Hes centering Leons eye on
	   the machine

						  LEON
			   I kinda get nervous when I take
			   tests

						  HOLDEN
			   Dont move

						  LEON
			   Sorry

	   He tries not to move but finally his lips cant help
	   a sheepish smile

						  LEON
			   I already had IQ test this year
			   but I dont think I never had a

						  HOLDEN
			   Reaction time is a factor in this so
			   please pay attention Answer as quickly
			   as you can

						  LEON
			   Uh sure

						  HOLDEN
			   One one eight seven at Hunterwasser

						  LEON
			   Oh thats the hotel

						  HOLDEN
			   What

						  LEON
			   Where I live

						  HOLDEN
			   Nice place 

						  LEON
			   Huh Sure  Yeah I guess Is
			   that part of the test 

	  Holden smiles a patronising smile

						  HOLDEN
			   Warming you up thats all

						  LEON
			   Oh
			   Its

						  HOLDEN
			   Youre in a desert walking along
			   in the sand when

						  LEON
			   Is this the test now 

						  HOLDEN
			   Yes   Youre in a desert walking
			   along in the sand when all of a sudden
			   you lookdown and see a

						  LEON
			   What one 

   It was a timid interruption hardly audible

						  HOLDEN
			   What 

						  LEON
			   What desert 

						  HOLDEN
			   Doesnt make any difference what
			   desert its completely hypothetical

						  LEON
			   But how come Id be there

						  HOLDEN
			   Maybe youre fed up maybe you want
			   to be by yourself who knows
			   So you look down and see a 
			   tortoise  Its crawling toward
			   you

						  LEON
			   A tortoise  Whats that

						  HOLDEN
			   Know what a turtle is

						  LEON
			   Of course

						  HOLDEN
			   Same thing

						  LEON
			   I never seen a turtle

	   He sees Holdens patience is wearing thin

						  LEON
			   But I understand what you mean

						  HOLDEN
			   You reach down and flip the
			   tortoise over on its back Leon

	   Keeping an eye on his subject Holden notes the dials
	   in the VoightKampff  One of the needles quivers
	   slightly

						  LEON
			   You make these questions Mr
			   Holden or they write em down
			   for you

	   Disregarding the question Holden continues picking
	   up the pace

						  HOLDEN
			   The tortoise lays on its back
			   its belly baking in the hot sun
			   beating its legs trying to turn
			   itself over  But it cant  Not
			   without your help  But youre not
			   helping

	   Leons upper lip is quivering

						  LEON
			   Whatya mean Im not helping

						  HOLDEN
			   I mean youre not helping  Why is
			   that Leon

	   Holden looks hard at Leon piercing look

	   Leon is flushed with anger breathing hard its a
	   bad moment he might erupt

	   Suddenly Holden grins disarmingly

						  HOLDEN
			   Theyre just questions Leon
			   In answer to your query theyre
			   written down for me  Its a 
			   test designed to provoke an
			   emotional response

	   Leon is glaring now the blush subsides his anger
	   slightly defused

	   Holden smiles cheerfully very smooth

						  HOLDEN
			   Shall we continue

	   Leon nods still frowning suspiciously

						  HOLDEN
			   Describe in single words  Only
			   the good things that come into
			   your mind  About your mother

						  LEON
			   My

	   Leon looks shocked surprised  But the needles in
	   the computer barely move  Holden goes for the in
	   side of his coat  But big Leon is faster  His
	   laser burns a hole the size of a nickel through
	   Holdens stomach  Unlike a bullet a laser causes
	   no impact  It goes through Holdens shoulder and
	   comes out his back clean as a whistle  Like a
	   rag doll he falls back into the seat  Big slow Leon
	   is already walking away but he stops turns and
	   with a little smile of satisfaction fires through
	   the back of the seat

	   As Leon walks out of the room the VoightKampff
	   begins to blink faint but steady

	   EXT CITY STREET  NIGHT

	   Lights from the blimp flash along the street and wipe
	   across the crowds of pedestrians as the VOICE TRACK
	   CONTINUES TO BLARE from above

	   A portable noodle bar is crowded with customers sit
	   ting on stools slurping their food out of bowls

	   DECKARD is standing near the noodle bar waiting for a
	   seat  Hes in his thirties wiry athletic rumpled
	   used unshaven  Hes holding a newspaper made of
	   tissue paper open while he glances at the blimp
	   passing NOISILY overhead  Then he notices the
	   COUNTERMAN

	   The Counterman is beckoning to him to a newly vacated
	   seat

	   Deckard sits down at the noodle bar and the Counterman
	   an elderly Japanese slaps a menu in front of him

	   No words on the menu just pictures of sliced fish
	   parts

	   Deckard points to a particular item and holds up four
	   fingers

	   The Counterman looks at the item on the menu confirms
	   the order by holding up two fingers

	   Deckard shakes his head no and repeats his four
	   fingers

	   The Counterman nods corrected and hurries off

	   Deckard glances overhead

	   The blimp drifts off among the buildings like a fish
	   disappearing in seaweed the NOISY VOICE doing a
	   diminuendo

	   Whap  The Counterman slaps a bowl of rice and a pot
	   of tea in front of Deckard  Then he puts the little
	   bowl with the two slices of fish on the counter

	   Deckard looks at the fish  Two slices of fish

	   He looks at the Counterman and holds up four fingers

	   The Counterman looks down at the two slices of fish
	   looks like two to him  He looks at Deckard as though
	   Deckard was a fool and holds up two fingers  He can
	   count

	   Deckard stares bleakly at the fish  Cant win

	   He starts to eat and thats when he feels a tap on his
	   shoulder  He glances over his right shoulder

	   A huge cop in uniform is looming behind him

	   Deckard feels funny looks left

	   Another cop is looming over his left shoulder

	   Deckard is tapped again from the right

	   Turning again he realizes that it isnt the cop tapping
	   him its the short Japanese guy next to the cop  The
	   guys got beady eyes and lots of energy  His name is
	   GAFF

						  GAFF
					in Japanese
			    You will be required to
			   accompany me sir 

	   Deckard doesnt understand Japanese thinks the man
	   wants a seat

						  DECKARD
			   Wait your turn pal

	   Deckard turns back to his food

						  GAFF
					in Japanese
			    If you do not comply with an
			   official request I will be
			   obliged to exert my authority 

	   Deckard is ignoring Gaff but the Counterman leans in
	   Deckards face and translates

						  THE COUNTERMAN
			   He say you go with him

	   Deckard turns and finds Gaff waving a badge in his face

						  GAFF
					in Japanese
			    To defy duly constituted
			   authority is to flaunt the public
			   good 

	   Deckard doesnt understand a word

						  THE COUNTERMAN
			   He say youre under arrest Deckard

	   Deckard turns back to his food

						  DECKARD
			   Tell him hes got the wrong guy
					turning to Gaff
					 loudly
			   You got the wrong guy pal

						  GAFF
					in Japanese
			    Wrong guy my ass  Youre
			   known as The Boogeyman in every
			   mean joint in town 

						  THE COUNTERMAN
			   He say Boogeyman

	   Deckard flinches at the word Boogeyman but goes on
	   eating  But now we know and he knows its not a
	   mistake

						  GAFF
					in Japanese
			    You are a Blade Runner in the
			   Four Sector and after the slaughter
			   at the steel shop they called you
			   Mister Nighttime 

						  THE COUNTERMAN
			   He say Brade Runner  He say
			   Mister Nightime

						  DECKARD
			   Tell him Im eating

						  GAFF
					to the Counterman
					 in Japanese
			    Please tell this notorious
			   gentleman that I am acting as an
			   emmisary from Captain Bryant and
			   Captain Bryant has ordered me to
			   bring Mr Deckard to headquarters
			   even if I have to serve him like
			   so much sushi 

	   Deckard is continuing to eat but he has reacted to
	   Gaffs repeated use of the word Bryant

						  THE COUNTERMAN
					to Deckard
			   He say you be ornery okay  He
			   say big boss Bryant give him
			   permission to use violence make
			   arrest  He say Bryant tell him
			   rearrange your brains akay  Make
			   you raw fish

	   Deckard looks disgusted and resigned

						  DECKARD
			   Bryant huh

										 CUT TO


	   EXT STREET  NIGHT

	   Deckard still holding his bowl of food is climbing
	   into a spinner behind Gaff as the two cops loom over
	   him  One of the cops shuts the spinner door behind
	   Deckard and the spinner lifts off in a flurry of wind

										 CUT TO


	   EXT CITY  BIRDS EYE VIEW  NIGHT

	   The spinner zips through the canyons of the city

	   Deckard is sitting in the passenger seat eating while
	   he watches the maze of suspension bridges platforms
	   and catwalks swim by below  The tops of larger build
	   ings emblazoned with fluorescent numerals and scrawls
	   of neon ads

										 CUT TO


	   INT SPINNER  NIGHT

	   Deckard is sitting gloomily in the passenger seat
	   still eating from his bowl with chopsticks as Gaff
	   maneuvers the spinner through the city canyons chat
	   tering in rapid Japanese

						  GAFF
					in Japanese
			   I told Bryant I could take care of
			   this myself  Just move me up
			   Ill do the job I told him  Five
			   phonies  I just air em out
					he imitates shooting
			   Bow  Bow  Bow

	   Deckard looks at Gaff uncomprehendingly

						  GAFF
					 continuing in Japanese
			   But no he says  Bryant thinks
			   youre hot shit smartest spotter
			   baddest Blade Runner  You dont
			   look so hot to me  Dont even
			   shave  Bad grooming reflects on
			   the whole department  You dont
			   dress well that reflects on me
			   makes the whole department look
			   like shit
			   The skin jobs look better than you
			   do  Whats the point of wiping out
			   skin jobs if they look better than
			   Enforcement  pretty soon the public
			   will want skin jobs for Enforcement
			   I guess youd prefer that hunh
			   That why you quit

	   Deckard looks at Gaff  He hasnt understood a word

						  DECKARD
			   I dont understand a word youre
			   saying

	   Gaff glares and mutters turning his attention to navi
	   gation of the spinner

						  GAFF
					in Japanese
			   Exactly  Whatta jerk  If I wasnt
			   up for promotion Id put this baby
			   in a hot spin and leave your dinner
			   all over the glass

	   The spinner flies low along the center of a busy
	   street and then turns right


	   EXT PRECINCT SPINNER PAD  NIGHT

	   The spinner slides toward the pad cuts speed and
	   gently touches down as another lifts off

	   An enormous grey vault of a building Deckard and Gaff
	   stride down the long corridor  Perhaps Gaff is still
	   jabbering in Japanese

										 CUT TO


	   INT BRYANTS OFFICE  NIGHT

	   BRYANT is sitting behind his big desk a fat man in his
	   fifties with grey hair jowls and gas

						  BRYANT
			   Hiya Deck

	   Deckard is standing in the doorway still in the cus
	   tody of Gaff  Deckard glares at Bryant and doesnt
	   answer  Bryant dismisses Gaff with a head movement
	   Deckard glares at Gaff who glares back as he departs

						  BRYANT
			   You wouldnt have come if Id just
			   asked you to  Siddown pal

	   Deckard glares at Bryant without moving

						  BRYANT
			   Dont be an asshole Deckard  I
			   got five skin jobs walking the
			   streets

	   Deckard smiles and sits down

						  BRYANT
			   They jumped a shuttle offworld
			   Killed the crew and passengers

	   Deckard reacts  This isnt usual

						  BRYANT
			   We found the shuttle floating off
			   the coast two weeks ago  So we
			   know theyre around

						  DECKARD
			   Embarrassing

	   Bryant is pouring bourbon into a thick shot glass  He
	   passes the amber tumbler to Deckard who takes it and
	   holds it to the light

						  BRYANT
			   No sir  Not fucking embarrassing
			    Because nobodys ever gonna
			   find out theyre down here because
			   youre gonna spot em an youre
			   gonna air em out

	   Deckard downs his drink and slides the empty back

						  DECKARD
			   Not me Bryant  I wont work for
			   you anymore  Give it to Holden
			   hes good

	   Deckard turns to go

						  BRYANT
			   I did

	   Deckard freezes and turns back

						  DECKARD
			   And

						  BRYANT
			   He can breathe okay as long as
			   nobody unplugs him

	   Deckard is impressed

						  BRYANT
					Not good enough  Not as
			   good as you  I need ya Deck
			   This is a bad one the worst yet
			   I need the old Blade Runner I
			   need your magic

	   Deckard meets Bryants pleading eyes for a beat

						  DECKARD

			   here
					pause
			    Im twice as quit now
			   See ya Bryant

	   Deckard turns to go

	   Bryants pleading look turns abruptly cold and hard

						  BRYANT
			   Stop the fuck right where you are

	   Deckard freezes at the hard tone

						  BRYANT
			   You know the score pal  When
			   youre not a cop youre little

						  DECKARD
			   Forgot there for a minute about
			   the little people  No choices

	   INT WHITE TILED ROOM DAY

	   We are looking at the bright image of a NAKED MAN in a
	   white tiled room with a white floor an abbatoir
	   without blood The naked man is very athletic His
	   face reveals nothing as he executes one physical demon
	   stration after another one handed pushups gymnastic
	   contortions etc An accompanying soundtrack drones
	   boringly and while we might pick up a few key words
	   such as emigration incentive and Man made
	   that we absorb the words they are the music to which
	   the image exercises

	   After a moment a series of lines cross the screen and
	   the image diminishes and we realise we are looking at
	   a monitor


	   INT BRYANTS OFFICE DAY

	   Deckard and Bryant are sitting in the dark looking
	   at a series of flickering monitors Deckard has a
	   bored expression on his face

						  BRYANT
			   We had an escape from the Off world
			   colonies two weeks ago Six repli
			   cants three male three female
			   Slaughtered twenty three people and
			   jumped a shuttle An aerial patrol
			   found the ship in the desert No
			   crew

						  DECKARD
			   These are old slave tapes show me
			   something new

	   The naked man continues to exercise as Bryant
	   continues

						  BRYANT
			   No sign of them then three nights ago
			   they tried to break into the Tyrell
			   Corporation one got fried going through
			   an electrofield but we lost the others
			   Going on the possibibility they might
			   try to infiltrate as employees we sent
			   Holden in to run Voight Kampff tests on
			   new workers  Guess he found himself one

	   The screen changes Roy Batty in a loin cloth is battering
	   a metal post with his fists  The smile on his face
	   indicates a total lack of pain  He continues to pummel
	   the post mercilessly his hands becoming bloody
	   The only sound is Batty humming Beethovens th

	   Deckard begins to look interested

						  DECKARD
			   Whos this 

						  BRYANT
			   Its a Nexus  Roy Batty Incept
			   date  combat model optimum self
			   sufficiency Probably the leader

						  DECKARD
			   Why would they come down here 
			   They coulda hid out 

						  BRYANT
			   You tell me pal thats what youre
			   here for

						  DECKARD
			   They must want something pretty important
			   to risk coming back here What do the
			   rest look like 

	   Bryant pushes a button And a series of revolving still
	   shots of Leon Pris Mary and Zhora appear on the screen

						  DECKARD
			   Why the Tyrell Corporation Why would
			   they return to the place of their
			   manufacture

						  BRYANT
			   Maybe they want to find out when
			   they were made 

						  DECKARD
			   Why would they bother

						  BRYANT
			   The Nexus  was designed to copy human
			   beings in every way except their emotions
			   But the makers reckoned that after a few
			   years they might develop their own
			   emotional responses  hate love fear
			   anger envy  So they built in
			   a fail safe device

						  DECKARD
			   Whats that

						  BRYANT
			   The Nexus  has only four years
			   to live

	   The screens go blank The lights go on  Bryant pours
	   two more drinks and hands one to Deckard

						  BRYANT
			   You got one more problem pal

	   Deckard downs the glass

						  BRYANT continuing
			   Looks like Holden found out that
			   VK machine doesnt work on the Nexus
			    The Tyrell Corporation has a demo
			   model so go check it out   If the
			   machine fails were in deep trouble

	   INT HOSPITAL  NIGHT

	   Small green letterforms skim soundlessly across a dark
	   glass panel  Beneath the panel a sick white face
	   reads excerpts from Treasure Island mouthing the
	   words as they appear in front of him  Its Holden

						  HOLDEN
					reading

	   Holden is flat on his back in a breather an iron
	   lungtype of device covered in indicator lights and
	   exotic paraphernalia  The hospital room is in com
	   plete darkness  Holdens breaths come in sharp rasps
	   as he reads

	   We become aware of Deckard standing in the shadows

						  DECKARD
			   Whatcha reading

	   Holden is startled has to look in a mirror angled over
	   his head rolling his eyes way back to see who it is

						  HOLDEN

			   terrific  Never saw ya look
			   better  Jesus you look good

	   Deckard pinches Holdens cheek

						  DECKARD
			   Great complexion  Suit looks
			   really nice  Whos your tailor

	   Deckard is making a joke mocking hospital good cheer
	   but the touch of bitterness in his voice reveals his
	   sympathy for Holden

	   Tears wet Holdens eyes

						  HOLDEN
			   A big fucking skin job put the
			   smash on me wrecked me up  Looka
			   me for Chrissake

	   Deckard works at being hard

						   DECKARD

						   HOLDEN
			   It aint like it used to be Deck
			   Its tough now These replicants
			   arent just a buncha muscle miners
			   anymore theyre no goddamn different
			   than you or me

	   Deckard lights up and sits down resting his elbows on

						   HOLDEN
			   Ten days ago Security at the
			   Tyrell Corp finds three intruders

	   Now we see for the first time Rachael a beautiful
	   woman in her late twenties dressed with taste and
	   dignity

						  DECKARD
			   Replicants are like any other
			   machine They can be a benefit
			   or a hazard If its a benefit
			   its not my problem

						  RACHAEL
			   May I ask a personal question

						  DECKARD
			   Go ahead

						  RACHAEL
			   Have you ever retired a human by
			   mistake 

	   Deckard blinks hesitates before answering the
	   question

						  DECKARD
			   No

						  RACHAEL
			   But in your position that is a risk

	   An OWL flaps around the huge marble office

						  TYRELL os
			   Is this to be an empathy test
			   Capillary dilation of the socalled
			   blush response fluctuation of the
			   pupil involuntary dilation of
			   the iris

						  DECKARD
			   We call it Voight Kampff for short

	   Deckard turns to see an older man very distinguished
	   very well tailored has entered the huge marble office
	   TYRELL

						  RACHAEL
			   Mr Deckard  Dr Eldon Tyrell

	   Tyrell has extended his hand to Deckard Deckard shakes

						  TYRELL
			   Demonstrate it I want to see it
			   work

						  DECKARD
			   Wheres the prototype 

						  TYRELL
			   I want to see it work on a person
			   I want to see a negative before I
			   provide you with a positive

						  DECKARD
			   Whats that gonna prove

						  TYRELL
			   Indulge me

						  DECKARD
			   On you

	   Tyrell indicates Rachael

						  TYRELL
			   Try her

	   Deckard looks at Rachael  Shes a beauty alright  He
	   shrugs

						  DECKARD
			   Its too bright in here

	   Tyrell hits a button

	   The windows darken a polaroid effect that seems to
	   give Tyrell the power to turn off the sun

	   Deckard is placing the Voight Kampff case on the table

	   The Voight Kampff opens like a butterfly as the room
	   darkens


	   INT TYRELLS OFFICE  A LITTLE LATER

	   Rachaels eye fills the screen the iris brilliant
	   shot with light the pupil contracting  We hear
	   Deckards voice and we have the impression the test
	   has been going on for a while

						  DECKARD OS
			   You are given a calfskin wallet
			   for your birthday

	   Tyrell stands silhouetted behind Deckard who sits in
	   front of Rachael

	   The needles in both gauges swing violently past green
	   to red then subside

						  RACHAEL
			   I wouldnt accept it also Id
			   report the person who gave it to me
			   to the police

						  DECKARD
			   You have a little boy  He shows
			   you his butterfly collection plus
			   the killing jar

	   Again the gauges register but not so far

						  RACHAEL
			   Id take him to the doctor

						  DECKARD
			   Youre watching TV and suddenly
			   you notice a wasp crawling on
			   your wrist

						  RACHAEL
			   Id kill it

	   Both needles go red  Deckard makes a note takes a
	   sip of coffee and continues

						  DECKARD
			   In a magazine you come across a
			   fullpage photo of a nude girl

						  RACHAEL
			   Is this testing whether Im a
			   replicant or a lesbian

						  DECKARD
			   You show the pciture to your
			   husband  He likes it and hangs
			   it on the wall  The girl is lying
			   on a bearskin rug

						  RACHAEL
			   I wouldnt let him

						  DECKARD
			   Why not

						  RACHAEL
			   I should be enough for him

	   Deckard frowns then smiles  His smile looks a little
	   like a grimace or the other way around

						  DECKARD
			   Last question  Youre watching
			   an old movie  It shows a banquet
			   in progress the guests are enjoying
			   raw oysters

						  RACHAEL
			   Ugh

	   Both needles swing swiftly

						  DECKARD
			   The entree consists of boiled
			   dog stuffed with rice

	   Needles move less

						  DECKARD
					continuing
			   The raw oysters are less acceptable
			   to you than a dish of boiled dog

	   Deckard switches off his beam

						  TYRELL
			   Well Mr Deckard

	   Deckard is looking at Tyrell and wincing indecisively

	   He doesnt get it  Are they playing with him

						  TYRELL
					continuing
			   Perhaps some privacy will loosen
			   your tongue Mr Deckard

	   He turns to Rachael

						  TYRELL
			   Would you step out for a few moments
			   Rachael

	   Rachael exits looking a little shaken  Whats going
	   on

	   Deckard stares at Tyrell

	   Tyrell meets his look

						  TYRELL
			   Im impressed  How many questions
			   does it usually take to spot one

						  DECKARD
			   I dont get it

						  TYRELL
			   How many questions 

						  DECKARD
			   In columns of four cross referenced
			   twenty or thirty

						  TYRELL
			   It took more than a hundred for
			   Rachael didnt it 

						  DECKARD
			   She really doesnt know 

						  TYRELL
			   Shes beginning to suspect I think

						  DECKARD
			   Suspect  How can she not know
			   she is

						  TYRELL
			   Well we began to notice in them
			   a strange obsession

	   Tyrell is pacing now lecturing

						  TYRELL
			   After all they are emotionally
			   inexperienced with only a few
			   years inwhich to store up the
			   experiences which you and I take
			   for granted  If we gift them
			   with a past we create a
			   cushion or pillow for their
				   emotions and we can
			   control them better

						  DECKARD
			   They want memories

						  TYRELL
			   Its the dark corners the little
			   shadowy places that makes you
			   interesting Deckard gusty
			   emotions on a wet road on an
			   autumn night the change of
			   seasons the sweet guilt
			   after masturbation

						  DECKARD
			   Jesus  ChristTyrell

	   Tyrell looks startled

						  DECKARD
			   Where do you get them the
			   memories

						  TYRELL
			   In the case of Rachael I simply
			   copied and regenerated cells from
			   the brain of my sixteenyear
			   old niece  Rachael remembers
			   what my little niece remembers

						  DECKARD
			   I saw an old movie once  The
			   guy had  bolts in his head

	   Deckard looks amazed while Tyrell looks pleased with
	   himself

	   INT DECKARDS APARTMENT  NIGHT

	   A blurry photograph unclear FILLS THE SCREEN

	   The photograph intensified  The foreground BLURS AND
	   SHARPENS  its the man in Leons room with the
	   wardrobe behind him  The head is turned away and
	   downward the face unreadable

	   Another change  A dramatic one  The picture is
	   suddenly three dimensional

	   Now we see that Deckard is studying the picture in a
	   viewer controlling the effects with punch controls

	   The ashtray next to him is full of butts  The bottle
	   of vodka is nearly empty

	   He sucks on his cigarette and empties the vodka bottle
	   into his glass and goes back to peering into the
	   viewer

	   He punches up

	   A transparent grid with vectors is superimposed over
	   the photo

	   Deckards eyes move over it carefully

						  DECKARD
			   Sharpen line fortyeight between
			   twenty point twentyseven

	   The edge of the man sharpens

						  DECKARD
			   Profile trace

	   Slowly the view tracks the periphery of the mans
	   shoulder up and around the skull down the other
	   side and as it approaches the bottom of the picture
	   passes a miniscule sparkle

						  DECKARD
			   Stop  Back up

	   The line is retraced

						  DECKARD
			   Stop

	   The faintest little sparkle  Static  Almost nothing
	   Deckard leans forward

						  DECKARD
			   Enhance

	   The view squeezes in  The spark seems to be coming
	   from about fifteen feet behind the figure  from
	   within the wardrobe

						  DECKARD
			   Seesaw

	   After a short pause as if the command causes the
	   machine to strain it emits a thin highpitched
	   FREQUENCY SOUND and the picture begins a horizontal
	   yawing motion  As it swings back and forth glimpses
	   of things previously obscured by the foreground
	   figure are revealed  Slightly at first but the
	   opening grows as the process picks up momentum

	   Deckards right down there hands on his knees like
	   a man watching his favorite team make a crucial play

						  DECKARD
			   Stop

	   The picture freezes

						  DECKARD
			   Enhance

	   The view pushes in to the wardrobe  In its gloomy
	   recesses hangs a dress

						  DECKARD
			   Enhance

	   In closer on the dress  An exotic shimmering gown
	   made of sequins  Deckard ponders it smiles slightly

						  DECKARD
			   I dont suppose one of those males
			   has a transvestite problem

	   Pause

						  DECKARD
			   Hey

	   Esper wakes up

						  ESPER
			   Yes

						  DECKARD
			   I said I dont suppose one of
			   those males has a transvestite
			   problem

	   Pause

						  ESPER
			   Negative

	   Deckard considers the situation for a few moments
	   then frowns thoughtfully and fishes his wallet out of
	   his pocket  He produces the flakes he found in the
	   hotel room

	   Deckard lights a cigarette

	   The flake

	   Hes holding it on the tip of his finger under the
	   light of the console screen  He sits down studying
	   it like Hamlet contemplating Yoricks skull  But
	   for the HUM OF THE MACHINE a long silence

						  ESPER
			   Youre gonna have a fire if you
			   dont turn off the machine

	   Absently Deckard reaches out and flips it off  He
	   sits a while in the silent dark  Then goes into the
	   bathroom


	   INT SHOWER  NIGHT

	   Deckard stands in the shower his cigarette still in
	   his mouth

	   EXT NOODLE BAR  NIGHT

	   It might be  am but the joint is still crowded
	   as noisy taxi drivers jostle each other for seats and
	   jabber in Kangaroo a crude lingual mix of Chinese
	   Japanese French and Tagalog

	   Deckard is hunched over his bowl of noodles slurping
	   hungrily from his busy chopsticks

	   Whap  The counterman slaps a serving of fish heads on
	   the counter in front of a CHINESE sitting next to
	   Deckard

	   Startled by the sound Deckard glances at the bowl of
	   fish heads then turns his attention back to his
	   noodles

	   But after two bites he frowns and turns to look at
	   the fish heads again

	   The Chinese is eating the flesh hungrily from a head
	   He cleans the skull and drops it on the plate

	   Deckard stares at the heads with their blank stares
	   that seem to gaze at eternity

	   Deckard is thinking

	   The Chinese is eating

	   Deckard frowns lost in furious thought  Suddenly he
	   reaches out and grabs a fish head

	   The Chinese goes bugeyed with indignation

						  CHINESE
					in Chinese
			   What the hell are you doing you
			   moronic ahng mo dim bulb  Thats
			   my goddamn dinner you in English
			   dumb shit

	   Deckard is peeling scales off the fish head  He grabs
	   his wallet produces the flake and compares it to the
	   scales from the head  He ignores the ranting of the
	   Chinese as he stares at the flake next to the scales

						  DECKARD
			   Fish

						  CHINESE
					in Chinese
			   What do you expect you get from
			   fish head stupid
					in English

	   EXT ANIMAL ROW  NIGHT

	   An aquarium full of fish weird looking fish the
	   kind that might eat each other  Theyre gliding in
	   sinister clusters like Doberman pinschers with gills

	   The CAMBODIAN LADY is a withered woman in black
	   Shes got a lens in her eye and shes looking at the
	   flake which is on the tip of her finger

						  CAMBODIAN LADY
			   Not fish  Snake 

	   And she points down the row

	   Deckard looks that way and we

										 CUT TO


	   MICROSCOPIC VIEW  NIGHT

	   We are looking at a huge enlargement of a snake scale
	   seen through a microscope but we dont know that
	   Its just a grand abstract weirdness blurring and
	   sharpening and changing

						  EGYPTIAN OS
			   The finest quality yeeeeeeessssss
			   Perfect workmanship
			   Geniune artificial snake

	   The flake  becomes a landscape of forests and moon
	   scapes  Buried deep in the texture of the thing is a
	   serial number

						  EGYPTIAN OS
			   Serial Number xbY
			   That would indicate a Crotalus

	   EXT EGYPTIANS JOINT  NIGHT

	   We see the Egyptian for the first time as he takes
	   his eye from the viewer and points to a snake in one
	   of the many tanks that writhe with groggy reptiles

						  EGYPTIAN
					continuing
			    such as that one there with
			   the black and white ring on tail
					making a whirring noise
			   Western Diamon Back
					whirr
			   Rattler

	   Deckard is looking at the ugly serpent

	   The Egyptian hands the scale back to Deckard

						  DECKARD
			   Who made it 

						  EGYPTIAN
			   This quality not too many

						  DECKARD
			   How many 

						  EGYPTIAN
			   Very few

						  DECKARD
			   How few 

						  EGYPTIAN
			   Perhaps less than I thought
			   but still more than I can remember

						  DECKARD
			   What helps you to remember 

	   The Egyptian pushes a hand out in front of him revolving
	   the thumb slowly against the next two fingers

	   Deckard slips a card out of his pocket and into the
	   mans fingers  Its a police card  It gets a super
	   cilious smile a sigh and a shrug  And thats all
	   it gets  The man knows his rights  The card is
	   handed back  The smile remains

						  EGYPTIAN
			   What was the question again

						  DECKARD
			   The question is

	   Deckard steps in closer

						  DECKARD
			   Are you a citizen

						  EGYPTIAN
			   Yes

						  DECKARD
			   Naturalized

						  EGYPTIAN
			   Yes

						  DECKARD
			   Your papers are in order

						  EGYPTIAN
			   Of course

						  DECKARD
			   You have a license for this
			   establishment

	   He points it out with a righteous finger

						  DECKARD
			   Fire permit

						  EGYPTIAN
			   Right here

	   He lifts it out of a drawer displays it  A long
	   pause  The Egyptian smiles smugly  It pays to have
	   things covered  Deckard pushes closer

						  DECKARD
			   In two seconds Im gonna break
			   your fuckin spine if you dont
			   tell me what I wanna know

	   Pause

						  EGYPTIAN
			   I see

	   Deckards face is two inches away  Its all very
	   plain

						  EGYPTIAN
			   In that case I think I will be obliged
			   to tell you that one of two men could
			   have done this

						  DECKARD
			   Who 

						  EGYPTIAN
			   Me

	   The Egyptian works on an uncertain shiteating grin
	   hoping to charm his way out of a hole

	   Deckard lets him sweat for a beat or two looking hard

						  DECKARD
			   Who do you sell your junk to 

						  EGYPTIAN
			   Artists Always to artists

	   The Eygptian looks nervously at Deckardsees he
	   means business and hastily begins to shuffle through a

						  DECKARD
			   six six five Thanks

	   Deckard breaks the connection then starts punching the
	   numbers

	   Behind him the stage show is progressing  A beautiful
	   woman named SALOME is emerging from the large egg very
	   scantily clad an erotic birth scene

	   Rachael appears on the telephone vidscreen

						  RACHAEL

	   INT BACKSTAGE A LITTLE LATER

	   You can hear applause and catcalls from the audience
	   as Salome flounces backstage  She starts toward the
	   dressing room

	   Deckard emerges from the shadow

						  DECKARD
			   Excuse me Miss  Salome

	   She turns  Deckards posture and attitude suggest humble
	   sleazy persistence  He comes closer with his shiteating
	   grin

						  DECKARD
			   Id like to have a word with you
			   if I could

	   Salome stands almost six feet tall in her high heels and
	   looks down on him with haughty suspicion a girl who
	   knows how to handle cheap hits

						  SALOME
			   Yeah 

						  DECKARD
			   Im with the  American Federation of
			   Variety Artists

	   He holds up a hand as if to stop her from protesting

						  DECKARD
			   Dont worry Im not here to
			   make you join thats not my department

	   He glances around like a guy whos not supposed to be
	   there

						  DECKARD
			   Im an investigator for the Confidential
			   Committee on Moral  Abuses

	   She nods taking it a little more seriously

						  DECKARD
			   Theres been reports of the
			   management taking liberties with
			   the artists in this place

						  SALOME
			   I dont know nothing about it

						  DECKARD
			   You havent felt yourself to be
			   exploited by the management in
			   any way

	   Shes definitely puzzled

						  SALOME
			   How do you mean exploited

						  DECKARD
			   Like to get this job did you
			   or were you asked to do anything
			   lewd or unsavory or otherwise
			   repulsive to your person

						  SALOME
			   Are you for real

						  DECKARD
			   Oh yeah  Youd be surprised
			   what goes on around here  Id
			   like to check the dressing room
			   if I could

						  SALOME
			   What the fuck for

						  DECKARD
			   For holes

	   This guy might be an asshole but hes funny

						  SALOME
			   I dont believe this

	   She shrugs and they go in


	   INT DRESSING ROOM  NIGHT

	   Musty cramped  A portable shower a dressing table
	   and not much else  On the dressing table lies a snake
	   Deckard watches it undulate into the warmth of the
	   lights

						  DECKARD
			   Is that mother for real 

						  SALOME
			   Of course hes not real  You think
			   Id be working here if I could afford
			   a real snake 

	   Deckard reaches out to touch it  As his fingers make
	   contact theres an electric snap  he jerks his hand
	   back from the shock

	   Salome is taking off her costume  Theres not much to
	   take off

	   Deckard gets a glimpse of nakedness as she slips behind
	   the screen and turns on the shower

						  DECKARD
			   How long you been doing a snake act 

						  SALOME
			   What is it with you you looking for
			   holes or what 

	   He starts pacing the room likes hes inspecting the walls

						  DECKARD
			   Youd be surprised  they have their ways
			   of doing their dirty work without the victim
			   even knowing whats going on

	   His fingers are moving over her gowns Theres about six of
	   them on hangers but nothing quite like the one in Leons
	   closet

						  DECKARD
			   Youd be surprised what a guyll go through
			   to get a glimpse of a beautiful body

						  SALOME
			   No I wouldnt

						  DECKARD
			   Little dirty holes they drill in the wall
			   so they can watch a lady undress

	   And to his amazement low on the wall behind the dresses
	   he actually spots one He moves down for a peek

						  SALOME
			   And what if somebody did try to exploit
			   me  Who do I go to 

	   Deckards peeking at a pair of fat legs in the next room

						  DECKARD
			   Me

						  SALOME
			   And who do I go to about you 

	   He looks around shes out of the shower dripping nude
	   Her hair blonde and cropped short  Her black hair is a wig
	   which now hangs on the wall next to the shower  She didnt
	   look like Nexus designated Zhora to begin with but even less
	   now

						  SALOME
			   So did you find any holes 

	   Deckard makes a sheepish grin

						  DECKARD
			   One so far

						  SALOME
			   Youre a dedicated man

	   Her smile is an invitation  She throws him a towel
	   He catches it and she turns her back to him

						  SALOME
			   Dry me

	   The evening doesnt have to be a total waste  Deckard
	   steps up behind her and starts patting her down

	   On the dressing table in front of them the python
	   noses through the cosmetics tongue flicking trying
	   to get back to its mistress  Caught up in the sensu
	   ousness of the moment absently she reaches out to
	   stroke the snake

	   Deckard works his way down her back over her buns and
	   as he reaches her thighs sits on the cot  Concen
	   trating on her buns he leans back for a handier per
	   spective  But jerks forward like hed been stung as
	   his ears are hit with the BUZZ OF RATTLES directly be
	   hind him

	   Partly hidden behind the pillow against the wall is
	   the Egyptians pride and joy a fourandahalf foot
	   ringtailed diamondback rattler  Its lethal looking
	   spadeshaped head elevated out of its coiled body
	   tail erect and whirring madly

	   Deckard rolls off the cot going for his blaster as he
	   hits the floor  SALOMEZHORA has her hand around the
	   head of the python and using it like a club she
	   brings it down with all her might

	   Deckard rolls out of the way as the SNAKE WHISTLES
	   through the air with such force it ruptures as it
	   hits the floor

	   If Deckards fast Zhoras a blur  As he FIRES her
	   foot kicks into his groin and he doubles up with the
	   pain of it  He tries for a second shot but shes al
	   ready out the door carrying a raincoat


	   INT PASSAGEWAY  NIGHT

	   Bottom lip between his teeth Deckard hops out of the
	   dressing room in time to see her go through the door at
	   the other end of the hall

	   It hurts to move so fast but he jacklegs after her
	   arrives at the door and flings it open  Blackness
	   The SOUND OF HER HIGH HEELS CLATTER down the metal
	   steps


	   EXT STREET  OPERA HOUSE  NIGHT

	   Its RAINING HEAVILY

	   The front of the Opera House is open only to foot
	   traffic these days  A bizarre place on a Friday night
	   hawkers and whores the rabble the poor and the curi
	   ous mill around the crudely built platforms and
	   brightly lit stands  Zhora in just a translucent
	   raincoat is not out of place in this flea market at
	   mosphere  Trying not to run she slices through the
	   mob as quickly as she can  Deckard is not far behind
	   dodging and sidestepping trying to move against the
	   tide of people scurrying for shelter

	   She comes to an intersection and turns out of the mall
	   onto a less crowded street  She glances over her
	   shoulder as she breaks into a run and runs right into
	   a couple of pedestrians  All three go down

	   Deckard comes out of the crowd in time to spot her get
	   ting to her feet  She sees him and runs  The two
	   pedestrians are in his line of fire  He runs past
	   them and drops to one knee leveling his blaster

						  DECKARD
			   Stop or youre dead

	   She doesnt

	   Deckard OPENS UP squeezing off two quick misses

	   WHAP  The corner of the building disintegrates 
	   bricks imploding dust in the air

	   FWAAAP  Another miss  A lamppost wrenched with a
	   tight air implosion  Twisted metal a breath of smoke

	   Deckard FIRES again

	   WHUMP  Zhora takes a hit in the back of the head and
	   thats it for her except her motor reflexes which keep
	   her going right into a showcase window

	   CRASH  Zhora explodes through a series of plate glass
	   windows in adjoining shops

	   Deckard is trying to pour FIRE through the tunnel of her
	   jagged wake but after TWO MISSES his blaster CLICKS
	   empty CLICKS empty CLICKS empty and he watches her
	   go

	   Zhora breaks through one window after another getting
	   sliced already shot running on reflexes  Glass
	   sprays like fireworks as she smashes through the last
	   two windows and into the street  Shes going too fast
	   to stop

	   She hits a passing bus so hard shes smeared all over the
	   side like a mural and the bus squeals to a halt

	   The rain has stopped and turned into a quiet DRIZZLE
	   WATER GURGLING down the gutters

	   Hunched over breathing hard Deckard comes slowly
	   forward  The crowd starting to gather  Something here
	   for everybody as theyre coming from all directions
	   Deckard moves through them ending up to the side of
	   the bus

	   Zhora is wedged on her side torn bloody and broken
	   All she can move is her eyes  they dart about like
	   a wounded animal doomed in a trap and stop on
	   Deckard

	   Hes kneeled in the street stooped low head cocked at
	   an awkward angle looking back at her

	   In the cramped and dripping darkness her eyes are turn
	   ing glassy  The intervals between the FALLING DROPS OF
	   WATER accentuate the silence until there is no dripping
	   and even the gurgling gutters have receded into silence
	   as the life drains out of Zhoras face until its
	   frozen dead

	   Deckards eyes slowly follow the rivulets of blood that
	   lead over the slope of a blacktop to his shoes  Deckard
	   tries to repress his wince  His eyes reveal that its
	   getting to him  Hes aware of the spectators around
	   him

	   Looking up he sees them moving nervously away from
	   him with frightened looks

	   Then he sees her  Rachael is standing in the crowd
	   staring at the dead Zhora

	   Rachaels face reveals her horror  She looks from Zhora
	   to Deckard

	   Deckard feels her eyes burn into him   He clicks his empty
	   pistol stupidly  CLICK CLICK

	   Lights from a spinner smear over the crowd sirens whine

	   Deckard sees Rachael disappear into the crowd

	   Deckard starts to say something but anything he said would
	   be drowned in siren noise

	   Rachael is swallowed up into the crowd near a big sign
	   or some other distinctive landmark

	   EXT THE CROWD  NIGHT

	   Leon and Batty are just faces in the throng of ASIANS
	   and LATINOS They too see the body of Zhora

	   Batty and Leon look very grim

	   They turn their attention to  Deckard

	   From their point of view they see a pantomime out of ear
	   shot Deckard hastily flashes his badge at arriving
	   COPS points to Zhora gives a couple of instructions and
	   hurries off passing under the big sign leaving the cops
	   to stare after him with amazement

	   Batty and Leon exchange a look Batty makes a head movement

	   Leon heads off toward the big sign

										 CUT TO


	   EXT STREETS  NIGHT

	   The tide of STREET PEOPLE moves inexorbaly as Deckard
	   like a swimmer moves through them eyes busy searching
	   for Rachael

	   Thinks he sees her

	   Shoves his way through the crowd

	   Not her

	   Looks around in dispair

	   Catches sight of her half a block away

	   Deckard hurries after her Calls out

						  DECKARD
			   Rachael  Wait

	   Rachael looks back sees him

						  DECKARD
			   Hold on

	   Rachael keeps going

	   Deckard is hurrying past the mouth of an alley  Suddenly
	   hes being hurried into the alley

						  DECKARD
			   Hey

	   A big guy is collaring him and hauling him into the alley

	   Leon

										 CUT TO


	   EXT ALLEY NIGHT

	   A family of SAMOANS look up from their dismal cooking
	   fire in the alley

						  DECKARD
			   Hey what the hell buddy

	   The Samoans faces are blank  They stick by the fire and
	   express no feelings anout the events in the alley

	   Deckard is swept off his feet and twirled around in
	   Leons beartrap embrace

	   Leon lets go and Deckard hits the pavement skidding
	   hard enough to tear clothes and burn skin but he
	   rolls out of it and comes up with gun in hand but Leon
	   is so fast hes already there and kicks it out of his
	   hand

	   Leon moves towards him backing Deckard against the
	   wall

						  LEON
			   How come you knew where Zhora was
			   so quick

	   His hand is like lightning  It shoots out grabs Deckards
	   hair

						  DECKARD
			   I showed pictures  Somebody
			   recognized her  I went to see

	   Deckard is pale  The sweat is starting to run

						  LEON
			   How old am I

						  DECKARD
			   I dont know

	   The grip tightens and twists

						  LEON
			   My birthday is April  
			   How long do I live

						  DECKARD
			   Four years

	   He lets go

						  LEON
			   More than you

	   Deckards knees come up fast but Leons fist comes down
	   faster like a hammer

						  LEON
			   Painful to live in fear isnt it

	   Deckard is doubled over hugging his thigh

						  LEON
			   But thats how it is to be a slave
			   The future is sealed off he
			   grovels he waits

	   Even hurt Deckard is fast  He goes for his ankle gun
	   but Leons got it out of his hand before he can even
	   raise it and throws it down the alley

	   Deckard hurls forward knocking him off balance and
	   scrambles to get away  Leon grabs him by the foot
	   drags him back and jerks him off the ground

						  LEON
			   Sex reproduction security the
			   simple things  But no way to
			   satisfy them  To be homesick
			   with no place to go  Potential
			   with no way to use it  Lots of
			   little oversights in the Nexus
			   Six

	   He slams Deckard into the wall

						  LEON
			   I tell you nothing is worse than
			   having an itch you can never scratch

	   Deckard slides down the wall to his knees and huddles
	   protecting his head with his arms waiting for the
	   next one

						  DECKARD
			   I agree with you

	   Leon folds his big hands together and raises them over
	   his head pausing just a second to savor the satisfac
	   tion of smashing Deckards skull

						  LEON
			   Too late  Your mistake

	   The spasm that runs through Leons face is not from
	   satisfaction  Its the bullet that went through his
	   neck  He hits the ground hard his big teeth biting
	   the air like a rabid dog  Dead

	   Deckard has slumped to the ground where he sits propped
	   into a sitting position by the wall staring up in
	   amazement at his deliverer

	   He sees Rachael standing there with his blaster
	   Rachael is staring at the body of Leon stunned and
	   shaken at what she has done

	   Deckard looks up at her his eyes swollen into slits
	   his mouth and nose bloody  He sees how shaken she is

	   Rachael turns and looks at him  Their eyes meet
	   She drops the blaster

	   Deckard gets painfully to his feet picks up the
	   blaster and starts to reload it  He doesnt make the
	   same mistake twice  He glances at her

	   Again their eyes meet

						  DECKARD
			   Tsing Tao

	   The Saleslady tries to hand Deckard a half pint but he
	   shakes his head and points and she produces a fifth

	   Deckard is paying when he feels a tap on his shoulder

	   He turns and sees Gaff leering at him

	   Not what Deckard expected or wanted  His eyes flicker
	   a warning in Rachaels direction

	   Rachael is standing in the flow of pedestrians Asians
	   Mexicans and Indians  She has already seen Gaff and
	   she gets the message in Deckards eyes and allows her
	   self to drift away part of the stream of humanity
	   moving down the sidewalk

	   But Gaffs sharp eyes have picked up Deckards look
	   and he glances

	   What Gaff sees is the back of a womans head in the
	   crowd

	   Gaff looks back at Deckard and makes a head movement
	   indicating the vehicle at the curb

	   Its a spinner and Bryant is grinning at the window
	   chewing on a heater

						  BRYANT
			   Christ Deckard ya look almost as
			   bad as that tit job ya left under

	   the street in the direction Rachael went

	   Gaff feels Deckards eyes turns and leers cheerfully
	   at Deckard  Deckard meets the look an ominous
	   exchange

	   dry blood and swollen splits again and blood gushes
	   into the clear liquid in the glass

	   Deckard stares at the bloodstained drink ruefully then
	   takes a thirsty gulp and licks his bleeding lip

	   The ice in  Rachaels glass is RATTLING  Shes standing
	   only a few feet away half eaten by shadows her eyes

	   He can hear the clock ticking and then the whisper of her
	   stockings as she approaches the bedroom from the hallway
	   He hears her stop lost in the shadows beyond the door
	   A pause then her voice

						  RACHAEL OS
			   The file on me the incept date
			   the longevity the psychoprogram

	   Her voice hesitates stops  Deckard sits there as the

	   the nerve to ask

						  DECKARD
			   Yeah 

	   In the shadows Rachael takes a deep breath

						  RACHAEL
			   You saw them

	   Deckard exhausted stares absently into space

						  DECKARD
			   Theyre classified

	   In the corridor Rachael persists with effort

						  RACHAEL
			   Youre a policeman

	   Deckard touches a spot on his forehead looks at the
	   wall

						  DECKARD
			   I didnt look at them

	   In the hallway Rachael is hardly breathing

						  DECKARD OS
			   I didnt want to

	   It must come as a tremendous relief to her  She stands
	   in the shadows grateful for the smallest favours  She
	   waits a moment hearing the clock ticking  hearing the
	   distant noises of an apartment house then she speaks
	   again

						  RACHAEL
			   That test of yours The Voight
			   Kampff test

	   She pauses before completing the question Its a
	   biggie

	   table

	   She looks at it for a long moment as though she might
	   be jealous

	   She sees a picture on top of the piano

	   A picture of a little boy and his father in fishing
	   clothes each holding a pole the boy proudly display
	   ing a single undersized fish the hint of a smile on
	   the fathers face

	   Batty smiles a smile totally without feeling or interest

	   Sebastian stares at Batty for a long moment then at Pris

						  BATTY
			   Why are you staring at us 

						  SEBASTIAN
			   Youre just so so different

	   Batty nods his head smiling sending home the fact and
	   Sebastian is certainly getting it

						  BATTY
			   What Sebastian 

	   A long pause

						  PRIS
			   What makes you think so Sebastian

						  SEBASTIAN
			   Well youre so perfect

	   Sebastian is grinning from ear to ear

						  SEBASTIAN
			   What generation are you 

						  BATTY
			   Nexus 

	   Sebastian whistles

	   To the couch Batty couldnt be more pleased

						  SEBASTIAN
			   I know because I do genetic design work
			   for the Tyrell Corporation
					proudly
			   Theres some of me in you 

						  BATTY
			   We have a lot in common

						  SEBASTIAN
			   What do you mean 

						  BATTY
			   We have similar problems
			   Accelerated decrepitude
					or
			   Like the fabled salmon we came home to die
			   But we dont want to die quite yet

						  SEBASTIAN
			   Of course not Could you

	   His voice is trembling

						  SEBASTIAN
			   Show me something

						  BATTY
			   Like what 

						  SEBASTIAN
			   Like anything

	   Like a million things but hes too excited to think
	   of one

						  BATTY
			   Were not computers Sebastian were
			   physical

	   Pris perks up proudly

						  PRIS
			   I think therefore I am

						  BATTY
			   Very good Pris  Now show him why

	   Without a moments hesitation Pris walks over to the
	   flask sticks her hands into the boiling water and pulls
	   out one of the eggs and hands it to Sebastian

	   Sebastian is riveted his eyes wide and astounded like
	   hes just seen the devil He laughs nervously glad that
	   the devil is a friend   Then drops the egg which is
	   suddenly burning his hand

						  BATTY
			   You could help us

						  SEBASTIAN
			   I dont know much about biomechanics
			   Roy I wish I did but youre out of
			   my league

						  BATTY
			   If we dont find help soon Pris
			   hasnt got long to live

	   Batty walks back to the chess set

						  BATTY
			   Is he good 

						  SEBASTIAN
			   Who

						  BATTY
			   Your opponent

						  SEBASTIAN
			   Dr Tyrell  More than brilliant
			   Hes a genius  Hes the Einstein
			   of genetics

						  BATTY
			   Maybe he can help us Sebastian

						  SEBASTIAN
			   Id be happy to mention it to him

						  BATTY
			   Be better if I could talk to him in
			   person  But hes not an easy man to
			   get to

						  SEBASTIAN
			   No

	   Batty leans forward and looks right into Sebastians eyes

						  BATTY
			   Will you help us 

						  SEBASTIAN
			   II cant

	   He gets up and walks slowly over to Pris

						  PRIS
			   We really need you Sebastian youre
			   our best and only friend

	   A smile begins to spread across Sebastians face  She
	   is irresistable He sits there for a long moment enjoying
	   her embrace

	   Batty leans back nodding in gratitude

						  BATTY
			   Im sure glad you found us Sebastian
			   What do you thin Pris 

						  PRIS
			   I dont think theres another human
			   being in this whole world who would
			   have helped us

	   INT TYRELLS BEDROOM  NIGHT

	   Tyrell is standing at the chess board in his nightgown
	   staring at the pieces in a fit of concentration  He
	   doesnt look up at the sound of footsteps

						  SEBASTIAN
			   Iuh I brought a friend

	   Tyrell looks alarmed

	   Batty is standing in the shadows

	   Tyrell is reaching for a tasseled bell pull that hangs
	   over his bed

	   Battys eyes are like little coals glowing

	   Warned by the look Tyrell abandons the bell pull and
	   reaches under the sheets for something

						  BATTY
			   To act without understanding
			   could lead to the very thing
			   the act seeks to avoid

	   Whats in Battys eyes completes the warning

	   Tyrell decides to heed it  If hes scared though he
	   does a good job of concealing it

						  TYRELL
			   Im surprised you didnt come
			   here sooner

	   Batty moves closer to the bed and the dogs slink away
	   scared toothless

						  BATTY
			   Its not an easy thing to meet
			   your Maker

						  TYRELL
			   And what can He do for you

	   Batty sits on the end of Tyrells bed

						  BATTY
			   Can the Maker repair what He makes

						  TYRELL
			   Would you like to be modified

						  BATTY
			   Had mind something a little more
			   radical

						  TYRELL
			   Whats the problem

						  BATTY
			   Death

						  TYRELL
			   Im afraid thats a little out of

	   Batty leans close across the sheets and cuts in in an
	   urgent whisper

						  BATTY
			   I want more life fucker

	   Sebastain looks alarmed

	   Tyrell faces Batty with admirable cool  After a tense
	   pause the old man slides away from Batty and out of
	   bed  Hes wearing a long night shirt and he looks a
	   little silly  He looks down at Batty whos still sit
	   ting on the bed and addresses him as a professor add
	   resses a pupil

						  TYRELL
			   The facts of life  Ill be blunt
			   To make an alteration in the
			   evolvement of an organic life
			   system at least by men makers
			   or not is fatal  A coding
			   sequence cant be revised once
			   its established

						  BATTY
			   Why

						  TYRELL
			   Because by the second day of
			   incubation any cells that have
			   undergone reversion mutation
			   give rise to revertant colonies 
			   like rats leaving a sinking ship
			   The ship sinks

						  BATTY
			   What about EMS recombination

						  TYRELL
			   Weve already tried it  ethyl
			   methane sulfonate is an alkylating
			   agent and a potent mutagen  it
			   created a virus so lethal the
			   subject was destroyed before we
			   left the table

	   Tyrell doesnt notice the subtle flicker of suspicion
	   on Battys face like maybe Battys not buying all
	   this

						  BATTY
			   Then a repressor protein that
			   blocks the operating cells

						  TYRELL
			   Wouldnt obstruct replication
			   but it does give rise to an error
			   in replication so that the newly
			   formed DNA strand carries a
			   mutation and youve got a virus
			   again but all this is academic
			   you are made as well as we could
			   make you

						  BATTY
			   But not to last

	   Battys expression doesnt reveal whether Tyrell has
	   allayed his suspicions as Tyrell approaches Batty
	   sitting on the edge of the bed and puts a fatherly
	   hand on Battys shoulder

						  TYRELL
			   The light that burns twice as
			   bright burns half as long  And
			   you have burned so very very
			   brightly Roy

	   Batty looks up at Father Tyrell Tyrell is swelling
	   with pride

						  TYRELL
			   The best of all possible replicants
			   Were proud of our prodigal son
			   glad youve returned  Youre quite
			   a prize

	   Batty looks down in a sudden uncharacteristically
	   humble posture and speaks with guilt in his voice

						  BATTY
			   Ive done questionable things

						  TYRELL
			   Also extraordinary things 

						  BATTY
			   Nothing the God of biomechanics
			   wouldnt let you in heaven for

	   Tyrell in a burst of camaraderie decides to give
	   laughing a try and comes out with a little titter
	   After all Roy Batty that swell replicant is about
	   to embrace him  Everythings gonna be okay after all
	   Batty gets up from the bed and puts his hands around
	   Tyrells face

	   CRACK  Tyrells skull cracks like dry wood

	   Sebastian stares in horror

	   SQUISH   Batty squashes the head in a gruesome moment

	   Tyrell slumps to the floor like empty clothes

	   Batty looks at the remains with disgust

						  BATTY

	   the hallway pressed flat against a wall  weapon up

	   Very carefully he slides along the wall

	   We can see a doorway ahead of him the door to Sebastians
	   apartment

	   He moves to the door Its open a crack He peeks in

	   The apartment seems empty

	   Deckard inches the door open blaster ready  He looks
	   around warily studying the apartment  He sees nothing
	   moving

	   He levels his blaster arm extended full out copstyle
	   as he ventures deeper into the apartment

	   Suddenly a noise behind him makes him spin blaster pointed

	   A mouse runs across the floor

	   Deep breath

	   WHUMP  Pris drops on Deckard from above and wraps her
	   bare thighs around his neck as she takes him down

	   Deckard finds himself choking ot death in bare thighs
	   as she applies a brutal scissors grip with her legs
	   All he can do is bite at the flesh near her crotch as
	   he fights for air and life

	   Pris might look like a punk waif but shes a powerful
	   replicant and Deckard is
	   falls from his hand as he writhes and
	   his body

	   Finally he gets his head loose and gasps for air but
	   she is immediately sitting on his chest and he looks up
	   into her furious face and flailing fists

	   Deckard grabs at her trying to fight her off tears
	   her tank top loose exposing one breast but a lot of
	   good that does him

	   Pris starts to choke Deckard with one hand and Deckards
	   only hope is to grasp blindly for his blaster on the floor

	   His hand paws wildly he cant look in the general
	   area and when he feels it he grabs it  He struggles
	   to point it at her

						  DECKARD
			   Please  I dont want

	   She catches his gun wrist and he fires a shot widly

	   BOW  Masonry erupts on the ceiling

	   Dekcard struggles to point the weapon but she has his
	   wrist in her replicant grip

						  DECKARD
			   Please  I dont want to kill you

	   Fat chance  It doesnt look like he could if he wanted
	   to  Shes choking him with one hand squeezing the
	   weapon loose with the other

	   Deckard fighting for breath and life gives a violent
	   wrench and manages to bring the weapon to bear just
	   long enough to squeeze off one shot

	   BOW  Priss left arm is torn away at the shoulder

	   Priss face erupts in fury as she clutches at the

	   as she spins away from Deckard and thats it she
	   goes down in a limp heap leaving Deckard standing there

	   INT FLOOR B  TOILET  NIGHT

	   Deckards head pops up through the floor next to an
	   overflowing toilet

	   All of a sudden he too starts to laugh as he lays down
	   on the floor his laughter becoming hysterical

	   He looks around for some tape and starts to wrap his broken
	   fingers

	   Suddenly with a resounding crash Battys head comes through
	   the marble above the basin

	   Deckard gets up and makes a run for the door at the end of
	   the room as Batty animal like starts slurping the water
	   out of the basin

	   EXT ROOF  WINDOW LEDGE  NIGHT

	   Deckard slowly eases himself around the window ledge
	   and edges his way around to a cornice

	   Batty appears at another window as Deckard scrambles
	   up the cornice and on to the roof wind and rain hindering
	   his climb


	   EXT ROOF  NIGHT

	   Wind and rain Deckard dashes onto the roof and looks
	   frantically over his shoulder Batty isnt in sight yet
	   He looks around desperately The roof is a desert no
	   shelter Deckard looks across at the next building

	   Suddenly a rooftop door opens and Batty steps out

	   Deckard looks back at the next building Is it possible 
	   A long jump But what choice

	   Decision time  Deckard decides to go  He runs directly
	   towards Batty turns pumping like crazy going for the gap

										 CUT TO


	   EXT THE ROOF  LOW ANGLE  NIGHT

	   Looking up from way below two buildings loom into the
	   dark with a gap between them and a tiny figure running
	   like hell and jumping

	   Deckard leaps across the gap flies through the air
	   almost makes it catches a cornice on the second
	   building hangs many stories up over the street and we

										 CUT TO


	   EXT THE SECOND ROOF  NIGHT

	   Deckard hangs onto the cornice in the wind and rain
	   One hand is almost useless the others strained to
	   the limit  He looks down  A long long fall to the
	   ground

	   Deckard looks behind him over his shoulder

	   He can see Batty twenty feet away on the edge of the
	   first roof watching him

	   Deckard is almost sobbing holding on with everything
	   hes got as we

										 CUT TO


	   EXT THE FIRST ROOF  NIGHT

	   Batty stands there watching Deckard hang

	   Batty grins

	   Then one of his hands cramps badly  He has to work the
	   fingers open with effort

	   He looks at Deckard again

	   Batty walks back five yards sprints quickly and
	   leaps as we

										 CUT TO


	   EXT ROOF  LOW ANGLE  NIGHT

	   From below we see the tiny figure of Batty as he leaps
	   easily across the gap between the two looming skyscrapers
	   and we

										 CUT TO


	   EXT SECOND ROOF  NIGHT

	   Deckard is hanging there as Batty lands not far from
	   Deckards desperate hands

	   Batty looks down at Deckard

	   Batty grins and takes a seat only a couple of feet
	   from Deckard

	   Deckards bad hand lets go  Hes hanging by one hand

	   The street looms way below

	   Deckard looks desperately into Battys cold eyes

	   Batty grins and shakes his head at the absurdity of it

	   Deckard looks into that awful smile and sees no hope
	   there

	   Batty glances down at his own hand  Spasms again

	   Deckards hand is going  He knows its over now he
	   bites the bullet of his anger  He glares at Batty as
	   his grip gives way

						  DECKARD
			   Asshole

	   Batty meets Deckards angry eyes

	   Deckards hand continues to slip

	   Batty is still looking at Deckards rage  It moves the
	   warrior in him you can see Batty change his opinion

	   Too late  Deckards hand goes

	   Battys hand is like lightning  He catches Deckards
	   hand and holds Deckard

	   Deckard is suspended above the awesome drop not sure
	   why hes not falling  He opens his tightly closed eyes
	   and looks up

	   He looks up into the stern warrior face of Batty the
	   cold eyes

	   Deckard hangs there and for a moment he has to consider
	   whether this is the continuation of a cruel game

	   The Batty is hauling him up onehanded and with that
	   scary strength he has

	   Deckard is pulled onto the roof where he lies on his
	   stomach gasping for breath not moving just feeling
	   something solid under him

	   Batty looks at the man gasping next to him with the
	   cold eyes of a man looking at a fish  It is as though
	   Deckard is some species far below Batty on the evolu
	   tionary scale

	   Battys hand cramps again

	   Batty looks at it almost with curiosity

										 JUMP CUT TO


	   EXT THE SECOND ROOF LATER

	   Deckard is looking at Batty

	   Batty is partly crumpled frozen in an unnatural posi
	   tion as though he had been writhing and stopped mid
	   writhe  He looks back at Deckard with eyes full of
	   life and intensity

	   They stare at each other for a long time in silence
	   communicating something with their eyes without
	   expression  Finally Batty breaks the silence

						  BATTY
			   Ive seen things
					long pause
			   seen things you little people
			   wouldnt believe Attack ships
			   on fire off the shoulder of Orion
			   bright as magnesium I rode on
			   the back decks of a blinker and
			   watched cbeams glitter in the dark
			   near the Tanhauser Gate
					pause
			   all those moments theyll be gone

	   Batty holds Deckards eyes like a hypnotist

										 CUT TO


	   EXT THE SECOND ROOF A LITTLE LATER

	   Batty is crumpled in a different position  Its light
	   er now and Battys eyes are staring into infinity
	   almost lifelessly  A pigeon flutters down and perches
	   on his shoulder  Batty doesnt stir

	   Deckard is watching motionless

	   The pigeon flies off

	   Batty doesnt move  Alive or dead

										 CUT TO


	   EXT THE SECOND ROOF  DAWN

	   A more distant perspective  Deckard is a small figure
	   looking down at the dead body of Batty

						  DECKARD VO
			   I watched him die all night  It
			   was a long slow thing and he
			   fought it all the way  He never
			   whimpered and he never quit  He
			   took all the time he had as
			   though he loved life very much
			   every second of it even the
			   pain  Then he was dead


	   EXT ROOF  DAWN

	   The city is down there  Endless and gray in the first
	   light

	   Deckards at the edge of the roof

	   Maybe someday hell be better  But right now he hasnt
	   even got the energy to be sick

	   The Mexicans voice doesnt surprise him it comes through
	   the silence like the rasping of ravens wings

						  GAFF
			   How do you rate yourself now Deckard 

	   He is standing  feet away on the edge of the roof like
	   a captain looking at the sea  Smarts as a roosterhe places
	   a foot on the buttress

						  GAFF
			   You put on quite a show  no doubt
			   about it

	   With a flourish he brings a dirty rag out of his pocket and
	   starts polishing the pointed tip of his long black shoe

						  GAFF
			   You think Im a wimp  dont you

	   He waits for the answer  But Deckard doesnt bother

	   Gaff moistens the rag with his tongue and applies it to
	   the toe

						  GAFF
			   I could kill you right now 
			   so you better say something

	   Deckard is unarmed Gaffs got all the aces seems to be
	   bristling with concealed weapons  Deckards eyes level on
	   him  His voice comes out low and raw

						  DECKARD
			   Yeah I think youre a wimp

	   Gaff nods like he knew it all along  it seems to please
	   him

						  GAFF
			   I admire you more and more

	   Deckard exhales fatigue  His eyes close The bullshit
	   is endless  Gaff smiles like a beaver Puts the rag back
	   in his pocket

						  GAFF
			   I guess youre through huh

	   Deckard doesnt answer

						  GAFF
			   Washed up Wiped out   Finished

	   He cocks his head like a bluejay waiting for the answer

						  GAFF
			   What about it

						  DECKARD
			   Yeah Im through

	   Somewhere far away a whistle blows Then silence Deckard
	   turns  He is moving away  His back to the Mexican Gaffs
	   voice follows him Taunting

						  GAFF
			   You did
			   sure you are man

	   He snickers His hand comes out of his pocket with a gun

						  GAFF
			   Its hard to be sure whos who around
			   here

	   Deckard keeps walking

						  GAFF
			   Carnall

	   Deckard slowly turns

	   Gaff shows him the gun But it doesnt make any difference

						  GAFF
			   Oye la agua

	   Deckard stares He doesnt know the words

	   Ever the dandy Gaff swaggers closer stops

						  GAFF
			   Here

	   He throws the gun across the gap to Deckard

	   Deckard doesnt try to catch it It lands at his feet

	   Gaff dismisses the rejection with a suck on his teeth

						  GAFF
			   I wouldnt wait too long I wouldnt
			   fool around Id get my little panocha
			   and get the hell outta here

	   They just stare at each other Gaff smiles

						  GAFF
			   Its too bad she dont last eh

	   The smile is real and a little sad

						  GAFF
			   But who does

	   Everybody knows the answer to that one

	   The Mexican shrugs

	   The light is brighter

	   The gun gleams on the wet

	   Deckard turns and walks

	   Deckard goes close

	   Rachael is on the bed  Completely motionless

	   Deckard leans over her very close to see if shes
	   breathing

	   A long moment

	   Then the tension goes out of him  Shes alive  He
	   turns away from her with a new urgency

	   He pulls the blaster from his holster and goes to the
	   dresser  He opens a drawer and pulls out a box of
	   ammo  Opens it

	   KACHUK  He slams a cartridge in the gun

	   KACHUK  Another

	   On the bed Rachael stirs opens her eyes  KACHUK

	   He is looking at her in the mirror on the dresser  He

	   Its the tiny unicorn made of tinfoil Gaffs
	   gauntlet

	   Deckard looks at it for a moment

										 CUT TO


	   EXT MOVING TREES  DAY

	   Birch trees whip past at  miles per hour urged on

	   woods

										 CUT TO


	   INT DECKARDS CAR  DAY

	   EXT WOODS  DAY

	   Deckards car bullets through the woods in a fury of
	   speed and MUSIC

	   We BACK OFF IT AND UP PAST whizzing branches OVER
	   the treetops losing the car as we SOAR over what is
	   suddenly a vast forest spreading to infinity

	   Enormous MUSIC

	   Deckards voice over

						  DECKARD VO
			   I knew it on the roof that night
			   We were brothers Roy Batty and I
			   Combat models of the highest order
			   We had fought in wars not yet
			   dreamed of in vast nightmares
			   still unnamed  We were the new
			   people Roy and me and Rachael
			   We were made for this world  It
			   was ours

	   Trees explode PAST US in a rage of branches as we DIP
	   and SWERVE and thats when the spinner looms INTO VIEW
	   zooming RIGHT AT US then tilting and yawing off in
	   hot pursuit with Gaff at the controls

	   CREDITS ARE ROLLING God help us all
