JACK VO
People were always asking me did I know Tyler Durden

FADE IN

INT SOCIAL ROOM  TOP FLOOR OF HIGHRISE  NIGHT

TYLER has the barrel of a HANDGUN lodged in JACKS MOUTH  They
struggle intensely

They are both around  Tyler is blond handsome eyes burning with
frightening intensity and JACK brunette is appealing in a dry sort
of way  They are both sweating and disheveled Jack seems to be losing
his will to fight

TYLER
We wont really die  Well be immortal

JACK
oor  eeee uh  aai 

JACK VO
With a gun barrel between your teeth you speak only in vowels

Jack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth

JACK still distorted
Youre thinking of vampires

Jack tries to get the gun  Tyler keeps control

JACK VO
With my tongue I can feel the silencer holes drilled into the barrel
of the gun  Most of the noise a gunshot makes is expanding gases  I
totally forgot about Tylers whole murdersuicide thing for a second
and I wondered how clean the gun barrel was

Tyler checks his watch

TYLER
Three minutes

Jack turns so that he can see down   STORIES

PG 

JACK VO
The building were standing wont be here in three minutes  You take a
percent concentration of fuming nitric acid and add three times as
much sulfuric in a bathtub full of ice  Then glycerin dropbydrop 
Nitroglycerin  I know this because Tyler knows this

Jack manages to SHOVE Tyler away  Then he leaps onto him and they
fall onto a table then roll off onto the floor  The gun falls and
slides  They wrestle with each other then dash for the gun  Tyler
gets there first and grabs the gun  DURING THE ABOVE

JACK VO
The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation
columns of this building with blasting gelatin  The primary charge
will blow the base charge and this spot Tyler and I are standing on
will be a point in the sky

Tyler drags Jack back to the glass wall and forces him to look out at
the city skyline

TYLER
This is our world now  Two minutes

JACK VO
Two minutes to go and Im wondering how I got here

moosie slobbering all over me was Bob

JACK
Yes  Were men  Men is what we are

JACK VO
Bob cried  Six months ago his testicles were removed  Then hormone
therapy  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high
and his body upped the estrogen  That was where my head fit  into
his sweating tits that hang enormous the way we think of Gods as big

Bob hugs tighter then looks with empathy into Jacks eyes

Jack walks in and joins the crowd

LEADER
Okay everyone  Chloe

Jack catches sight of Marla scowls at her  Taking the lectern is
CHLOE a pale sickly girl whose skin stretches yellowish and tight
around her bones  She wears a head bandage  OVER the beginning of her
SPEECH

JACK VO
Chloe looked the way Joni Mitchells skeleton would look if you made it
smile and walk around a party being extra nice to everyone

CHLOE
My status update is  Im still here  but I dont know for how
long  Thats as much certainty as they can give me  Im in a pretty
lonely place  No one will have sex with me  Im so close to death and
all I want is to get laid for the last time  I have pornographic
movies in my apartment and lubricants and amyl nitrate 

The LEADER hardly knows what to do  He inches his way to the lectern
and gingerly takes control of the microphone

LEADER
Thank you Chloe   Everyone close your eyes for meditation  Go to
your cave and find your power animal

smoke with her eyes closed

INT CHURCH  LATER

The Leader smiling opens his eyes and looks around the group

LEADER
Good  Now  Pair off for the oneonone  Pick someone special to you
tonight

Everyone stands and mills about slowly pairingoff  Jack sees the
ghastly spectre of Chloe coming towards him  He smiles at her  She
smiles back it takes her some time to amble to him

CHLOE
Hello Cornelius

JACK VO
I never gave my real name at support groups

CHLOE
Im showing signs of improvement

JACK VO
Everyone was always getting better  They never said parasite they
said agent

She smiles at him with a twisted dying mouth  Her eyes eerily bright
with desperation  Jacks lip trembles as he in a sincere attempt at
levity chokes out

JACK
You  look  like a pirate

Chloe laughs a little too much  Jack squeezes out a laugh  Then he
sees Marla off by herself  Someone is heading for her  Most people
have pairedoff  Jack gives a quick nod to Chloe and darts for Marla
grabbing her  Chloe watches in sad surprise

STAY ON JACK AND MARLA as he drags her off to the periphery  He
whispers into her ear

JACK
We need to talk

PG 

MARLA
O  kay  Sure

JACK
Youre a faker  You arent dying  Okay in the brainy brainfood
philosophy way were all dying  But youre not dying the way Chloe is
dying

MARLA
Youre not dying either 
reading his nametag
 Cornelius

MARLA
 Telling me off  Is it going as well as you thought it would

JACK
Ill expose you

MARLA
Go ahead

MEDIATOR
Let yourself cry

Marla puts her head down on Jacks shoulder as if she were crying 
Jack pulls her head back up  She deadpans at him

JACK
Ive put in some serious time on these groups  Ive been coming for a
year

MARLA
Mustve been tough to pull off

PG 

JACK
Anyone who mightve noticed me in that time has either died or
recovered and never come back

MARLA
Why do you do it

JACK
Why do you

No answer  The Leader passes right by Jack and Marla

LEADER
Open up  share with each other

JACK
 If people think youre dying they really listen instead of just
waiting for their turn to speak  Everything else about credit card
debts and sad radio songs and thinning hair goes out the window

MARLA
It started with a lump  I went to a breast cancer support group  The
lump turned out benign  But I still needed my Monday fix  So I went
to lymphoma just to check it out  Dying people are so alive

JACK
It becomes an addiction

MARLA
Yeah 

Jack almost smiles then turns sullen  He pulls back from her

LEADER
Now the closing prayer

JACK
Look I cant go to a group with a faker present

Marlas mood hardens

MARLA
Well I cant either

MARLA

She opens another dryer and does the same thing again

PG 

JACK

MARLA

JACK

Marla drops all the clothes on a back counter  An old CLERK sifts
through the clothes marks on a pad

PG 

MARLA

JACK
Well split it  You get it the first and third Sunday of the month

MARLA

They shake hands  Jack starts to withdraw his Marla holds it

MARLA

JACK
Lets not make a big deal out of this

She walks toward the door  Jack watches her go

MARLA not looking back
Hows this for not making a big deal

EXT SIDEWALK  CONTINUOUS

Jack dashes out and catches up to her

JACK
Uh Marla  Should we exchange phone numbers

MARLA
Should we

JACK
In case we want to switch nights

PG 

MARLA
Uhhunh  Sure

He takes out a business card and a pen  He writes his home number on
the back and hands it to her  She takes his pen grabs his hand and
writes her number on his palm  She gives him a quick grin slaps the
pen back into his palm then saunters out into the middle of the
street causing more screeching of tires and honking  She turns back
holding up the card

MARLA
It doesnt have your name on it  Who are you  Cornelius  Any of the
stupid names you give at group

Jack starts to yell but the traffic noise is too loud  Marla just
shakes her head at him turns and keeps moving away  A bus moves into
view and stops obscuring her

JACK VO
Marlas philosophy of life I later found out was that she could die
at any moment  The tragedy of her life was that she didnt

INT WAREHOUSE  CONTINUOUS

And Jack sets down his briefcase opens it and starts to make notes on
a FORM

JACK VO
Im a recall coordinator  My job was to apply the formula  Its
simple arithmetic

TECHNICIAN 
Heres where the baby went through the window  Three points

JACK VO
Its a story problem  A new car built by my company leaves Boston
traveling at  miles per hour  The rear differential locks up

TECHNICIAN 
The teenagers braces locked around the backseat ashtray  Kind makes a
good antismoking ad

JACK VO
The car crashes and burns with everyone trapped inside  Now do we
initiate a recall

TECHNICIAN 
The father mustve been obese  See how the fat burned into the
drivers seat mixed with the dye of his shirt  Kind like modern art

JACK VO
You take the number of vehicles in the field A and multiply it by the
probable rate of failure B multiply the result by the average
outofcourt settlement C  A times B times C equals X  If X is less
than the cost of a recall we dont do one

INT AIRPLANE CABIN  TAKING OFF  NIGHT

JACK

LADY
Oh

Jack turns his attention to the window as the PLANE ASCENDS  The
ladys VOICE FADES  Jack sees a PELICAN get SUCKED into the TURBINE 
His face remains bland during the following

The plane BUCKLES  the cabin wobbles loosely  People begin to panic
 Oxygen masks fall

JACK VO
Life insurance pays off triple if you die on a business trip

A forceful IMPACT with the ground and people  except for Jack 
LURCH FORWARD some jerking against their seatbelts magazines and
other objects fly forward

JACK VO
No more expense accounts receipt required for over twentyfive
dollars

A BALL OF FIRE swoops forward from the rear of the cabin and
INCINERATES EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY  except Jack who remains in his
same position in his seat with the bland expression

JACK VO
No more haircuts  Nothing matters not even bad breath

DING  the seatbelt light goes OUT

EVERYTHING IS NORMAL

JACK VO
Always the same fantasy  But  no such luck

Jacks eyes are closed  He seems asleep  From next to him a VOICE
weve heard before

VOICE
There are three ways to make napalm  One mix equal parts of gasoline
and frozen orange juice

PG 

Jacks eyes snap open and he turns to see Tyler who is staring out
the window  Without turning to Jack he continues

TYLER
Two mix equal parts of gasoline and diet cola  Three dissolve
crumbled cat litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick

Jacks smile fades  Tyler turns to him and grins  He reaches down
under the seat in front of him and pulls up a briefcase  Jack looks at
it with trepidation

JACK VO
This is how I met 

Tyler offers his hand Jack takes it and Tyler squeezes firmly and
shakes hands

TYLER
Tyler Durden  You know why they have oxygen masks on planes

JACK
Supply oxygen

TYLER
Thats a sharp answer  The oxygen gets you high  Youre taking in
giant panicked breaths and suddenly you become euphoric and docile
and you accept your fate

Tyler grabs a safety instruction card from the seat pocket and shows
Jack the passive faces on the drawn figures  Tyler imitates the face 
Jack laughs he is completely beguiled

JACK
What do you do Tyler

TYLER
What do you want me to do

JACK 
I mean  for a living

TYLER
Why  So you can say Oh thats what you do   And be a smug
little shit about it

Jack laughs  He points to his own briefcase under the seat in front
of him

PG 

JACK
We have the same briefcase

Tyler pops the latches on his briefcase  A beat while Jacks
expression turns nervous again about whats inside  Tyler swings the
lid up revealing a full bounty of quaintlywrapped bars of soap

TYLER
I make and sell soap

He gives Jack one  Jack takes it looks it over

TYLER
If you add nitric acid to the soapmaking process you get
nitroglycerin  With enough soap you could blow up the world

Jack now looks at the bar of soap nervously  He looks at Tyler slowly
smiles and shakes his head

Tyler takes out a blank BOARDING PASS  He takes out a small stencil
scrapes a pencil over it creating a seat number which looks printed 
Then he takes out a stamp and ink pad  He stamps the pass

JACK
Uh  why are you going to Wilmington

TYLER
I live there

JACK
Me too

Tyler shuts his briefcase and stands

TYLER
Excuse me

Jack stands allowing Tyler to pass into the aisle

JACK
So uh  we should hook up sometime

Jack hands Tyler a business card  Tyler snatches it writes down a
number hands it back to Jack

JACK
Tyler youre by far the most interesting singleserving friend Ive
ever met

PG 

A beat as Tyler stares at him deadpan  Jack enjoying his own chance
to be witty leans a bit closer to Tyler

Jack sits and watches Tyler walk up to the curtain dividing First

him through the curtain

INT BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA  WILMINGTON  NIGHT

Utterly empty of baggage and except for Jack and a SECURITY TASK
FORCE MAN utterly empty of people quiet  The Security TFM smirking
holds a receiver to his ear from an official phone on the wall

SECURITY TFM to Jack
Throwers dont worry about ticking  Modern bombs dont tick

JACK
Throwers

SECURITY TFM
Baggage handlers  But when a suitcase vibrates the throwers have to
call the police

JACK
My suitcase was vibrating

PG 

SECURITY TFM
Nine times out of ten its an electric razor  One out of ten its a
dildo  Sometimes its even a man  Its airline policy not to imply
ownership in the event of a dildo  We gotta use the indefinite
article  A dildo  Never Your dildo

JACK VO
I had everything in that bag  Six white shirts two black trousers
six pair underwear alarm clock contact lens stuff and  cordless
electric razor

The Security TFM turns to Jack shakes his head hangs up the phone
shrugs

EXT AIRPORT DRIVE  MOMENTS LATER

Jack waits by the curb as a TAXI approaches

JACK VO
Things could be worse  A spider could lay eggs under the skin in your
face and the larva could tunnel around and baby spiders could burst
from your nostrils

PG 

INT TAXI  MOVING  NIGHT

Along a residential street  Jack looks ahead sees a tall grey bland
building on the corner

JACK VO
Home was a condo on the fifteenth floor of a filing cabinet for widows
and young professionals

The taxi approaches the intersection

JACK VO
The walls were solid concrete  A foot of concrete is important when
your nextdoor neighbor lets her hearing aid go and has to watch game
shows at full blast 

The taxi turns a corner and Jack sees the front of the building  A
diffuse CLOUD of SMOKE wafts away from a BLOWNOUT SECTION on the
fifteenth floor  FIRETRUCKS POLICECARS and a MOB are all crowded
around the lobby area

JACK VO
 Or when a volcanic blast of burning gas and debris that used to be
your furniture and personal effects blows out your floortoceiling
window and sails down flaming to leave just your condo  only yours 
a gutted charred concrete hole in the cliffside of the building

EXT STREET IN FRONT OF BUILDING

Jack gaping at the sight above him absently gives the Cabbie money 
The taxi pulls away  Jack stands frozen

JACK VO
These things happen

Jack starts toward the building  He enters the fray of people pushes
through to the lobby  The DOORMAN sees him gives a sad smile shakes
his head  Jack starts for the elevator

DOORMAN
Theres nothing up there

Jack presses the button waits  The Doorman moves next to him

PG 

DOORMAN
You cant go into the unit  Police orders  Theyre investigating for
arson

The elevator doors open  Jack hesitates  The doors close

DOORMAN
Do you have someone you can call

Jack heads back for the lobby doors  The Doorman follows

Jack walks past SMOKING CHARRED DEBRIS  a flash of ORANGE  from the

The gas then could have slowly filled the condo from floor to ceiling
in every room  Seventeenhundred square feet with high ceilings for
days and days

Deliver me from Swedish furniture  Deliver me from clever art

DOORMAN
If you dont know what you want you end up with a lot you dont

May I never be content  May I never be complete  May I never be
perfect  Deliver me

parking lot  A few street lamps illuminate the lot  a freeway runs
nearby

INT LOUS TAVERN  SAME

Jack and Tyler sit at a table in the very back of the room  A
halfempty pitcher of beer shows dried foam scum from the previous
refill

Five DRUNKEN GUYS at a table at the opposite side of the bar keep
glancing over and chuckling in a potentially hostile manner

TYLER
You buy furniture  You tell yourself this is the last sofa youll
ever need in your life no matter what else goes wrong youve got the
sofa issue handled  Then the right set of dishes  Then the right bed
 The drapes  The rug  This is how youre good to yourself  This is
how you fill up your life

JACK
I  guess so

TYLER
And now your condo blows up and you have nothing

JACK 
I  guess so

TYLER
And now you find yourself sitting here feeling like its the best
thing that ever happened to you

JACK
 yeah

TYLER
I dont know you so maybe Im wrong  Maybe its a terrible fucking
tragedy

JACK 
 no

PG 

TYLER
I mean you lost a lot of nice perfect neat little shit

JACK
Fuck it all

TYLER
Wow  Thats pretty strong

JACK

TYLER
Do you have family you can call

My mother would just go into hysterics  My Dad   Dont know where
he is  Only knew him for six years  Then he ran off to a new city
and married another woman and had more kids  Every six years  new
city new family  He was setting up franchises

Tyler smiles snorts shakes his head

TYLER
A generation of men raised by women  Look what its done to you

JACK

TYLER

JACK
Huh

TYLER
Why dont you cut the shit and ask me if you can stay at my place

JACK
Well  uh 

TYLER

TYLER

And we can see its a PENIS

INT PROJECTIONIST ROOM  THEATRE  NIGHT

Jack in the foreground FACES CAMERA  In the BACKGROUND Tyler sits
at a bench looking at individual FRAMES that have been cut out of
movies  Near him the PROJECTOR rolls a film

JACK
Tyler works some nights as a projectionist  A film doesnt come in one
big reel 

Tyler speaks to Jack normally not to the camera

TYLER
In an old theatre two projectors are used  I have to change
projectors at the exact second so the audience never sees the break
when one reel starts and one reel runs out  You can see two dots on
screen at the end of a reel  this is the warning

PG 

JACK
He splices single frames of genitalia from porno movies into family
films

TYLER
Onetwentyforth of a second  Thats how long the penis flashes up
there  Towering slippery red and terrible and no one knows theyve
seen it

Jack and Tyler watch the audience of PARENTS and CHILDREN as an ANIMAL
adventure MOVIE plays  Suddenly children start becoming uncomfortable
and squirming  Some start CRYING  Some THROW UP

The GUESTS are dressed in resplendent clothes reeking of wealth and
privilege  They command the WAITERS with snaps of the finger 
Complaints pop like gunshots  The stiffnecked CATERING MANAGER
contemptuously hawkeyes the waiters  Its hellish

INT SERVICE ELEVATOR  NIGHT

JACK
He was a guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry

TYLER OS

PG 

After a beat the sound of WATER SPLASHING the floor  Jack peeks and
sees Tyler pouring out a water glass with one hand the other hand at
his crotch

TYLER
 Oh yeah  Oh yeah

Jack turns back TO CAMERA

JACK
He farted on creme brulee he sneezed on braised endive and with
creme of mushroom soup he  he 

TYLER OS
Go ahead  Say it

JACK
Well you get the idea

EXT PARKING LOT OF TAVERN  RESUMING

Tyler and Jack come out of the bar Jack shakes his head

JACK

TYLER
Hit me as hard as you can

Tyler leads Jack into an open area lit by a streetlamp

JACK
I dont know about this Tyler

TYLER
I dont know either  I want to find out  Were virgins  Neither one
of us has ever been hit

JACK
Youve never been in a fight

TYLER
I didnt say that  I said Ive never been hit

JACK
Thats good isnt it

TYLER
Listen to me  hit me  Youre the only one I ever asked

PG 

JACK
Me

Jack stares at him  The five drunken GUYS  the same ones who stared
at them earlier  have formed a distant perimeter sensing a fight 
Jack glances at them then back at Tyler

JACK
Ive  never hit anyone in my life

TYLER
Go crazy  Let it rip

JACK
Where do you want it  In the face or the stomach

TYLER
Surprise me

Jack swings a wide clumsy roundhouse that connects with Tylers neck 
It makes a dull soft flat sound  Tylers neck turns red

JACK
Shit  Sorry  That didnt count  Let me try again

TYLER
Like hell  That counted

Tyler shoots out a straight punch to Jacks chest  The impact makes a
dull barelyaudible sound and Jack falls back against a car  The Guys
whoop and clap moving closer  Jacks eyes involuntarily well up with
tears  He and Tyler breathe HEAVILY and sprout BEADS of SWEAT on their
faces

TYLER
How do you feel

JACK
Strange

TYLER
But a good strange

JACK
Is it

TYLER
Weve crossed the threshold

PG 

JACK
 I guess so

TYLER
You want to call it off

JACK
Call what off

TYLER

JACK
What fight

TYLER
Im tired of watching only professionals  I dont want to die without
any scars  How much can you really know about yourself if you never go
at it oneonone

JACK
Tyler 

TYLER
Are you a pussy

Jack swings another roundhouse that slams right under Tylers ear  The
sound soft and flat  Tyler punches Jack in the stomach  The Guys
move closer cheering the fight  Tyler and Jack move clumsily
throwing punches  They breathe heavier their eyes red and bright 
They drool saliva and blood  They each hurt badly and become dizzier
from every impact

JACK VO
If youve never been in a fight you wonder about getting hurt about
what youre capable of doing against another man

Tyler and Jack keep fighting  The guys mix laughter with their cheers
looking at each other in wondrous amusement

EXT CURBSIDE  LATER

Jack and Tyler sit on the curb staring at the sparse headlights on the
nearby freeway  Their eyes are glazed with endorphininduced serenity
 They look at each other  Laugh  Look away

my support groups  Everything thats broken and doesnt work in my

cheek

JACK VO
Thursday morning my Boss didnt know what to think

Boss blocks him from the rest of the room gives him a dubious look
turns back to Walter

JACK VO
And all I could do was think about next week

Walter advances to the next slide showing a view of a COMPUTER SCREEN

WALTER
The basic premise of microsofting your office is  make things more
efficient

As Walter continues his sales pitched gets drowned out by Jacks
narration

JACK VO
Walter the Microsoft account exec smiled at me with his steam shovel
jaw  Walter with his smooth soft hands  Here he was doing his cute
little show  Maybe thinking about a freerange potluck hed been to
last weekend but probably not

Walter moves to Jack and slaps his shoulder

WALTER
I showed this already to my man here  You liked it didnt you

Slowly Jack smiles  His teeth are RED with BLOOD  They GLOW eerily
in the dim light

JACK VO
You can swallow a pint of blood before you get sick

WALTER
Jeez Id hate to see what happened to the other guy

Jack keeps the smile frozen on his face

JACK VO
Fuck Walter  His candy ass wouldnt last a second in fight club

EXT LOUS TAVERN  NIGHT
Out of silent darkness HEADLIGHTS appear from all directions  A
synchronous WAVE of cars PULLS UP and parks in the alreadyfilled lot 
Young men get out of the arriving cars and wander into the tavern  We
recognize among them the GUYS who watched Tyler and Jacks first
fight

INT LOUS TAVERN  SAME

The men enter the bartender IRVINE calls out

IRVINE
Drink up people  Were closing  Lets go

The crowd consists of men and women YUPPIES blue collar REGULARS
dressed in work clothes or like cowboys floozy barfly WOMEN  MUSIC
plays from the jukebox

The arriving men simply wait  And wait  Tyler and Jack enter  They
too stand back against he wall

The waiting army begins to share secret looks and grins  A certain
level of eagerness can be seen among them

Irvine looks at Jack and grins  He flips on LIGHTS  The drunken
customers squint and get the message  They gulp down their drinks
plop down money and filter out the door  Irvine hits a button and the
jukebox loses  power  the record simply turns slower until it stops
revolving

Finally the last of the irritated customers leaves  One guy locks the
door  Two other guys pull down blinds  Someone else moves over to the
BASEMENT DOOR and opens it

INT BASEMENT STEPS  MOMENTS LATER

The grinning men march down steps CHATTER begins

INT TAVERN BASEMENT  SAME

A BOMBSHELTER  concrete floor concrete walls  One BARE LIGHT BULB
hangs by a wire from the ceiling  Tyler nods to Jack and Jack turns on
the light  The guys mill around finding partners  The whole mood is
very friendly  Everyone brims with eagerness but tries to act cool
about it  CHATTER gets LOUDER

FAT GUY
A mean uppercut

WIRY GUY
I gotta work on my left

SHORT GUY
Hes got a left

FAT GUY
Hey youre wiping the floor with dudes who are way out of your weight
class

TALL GUY slapping Wiry Guys shoulder
Skinny guys  They fight till theyre burger

PEAKING CHATTER then  Tyler moves into position directly under the
light bulb  His face is partially in shadow

Everyone spreads out forming a circle the light bulb for a center 
Tylers will WIPES through the room and the CHATTER DIES  A couple of
COUGHS FEET SHUFFLING  Then SILENCE

TYLER
The first rule of fight club is  you dont talk about fight club 
The second rule of fight club is  you dont talk about fight club

Jack glances over at a short guy RICKY with a BLACK EYE

JACK VO
This kid Ricky  supply clerk  he cant remember whether you
ordered pens with blue ink or black ink 

TYLER
The third rule in fight club is  when someone says stop or goes
limp the fight is over  The fourth rule is  only two guys to a
fight

PG 

JACK VO
But Ricky was a god for ten minutes when he trounced an actuary twice
his size

TYLER
Fifth rule  one fight at a time  Sixth rule  no shirts or shoes 
Seventh rule  fights go on as long as they have to  And the eighth
rule of fight club is  if this is your first night you have to
fight

Tyler steps back and a FAT MAN and a GOATEED MAN take off their shirts
and shoes and step into the center  They circle each other then begin
throwing punches  SWEAT flies into the moist air  SHOUTS become
DEAFENING

JACK VO
Sometimes you could hear flat hard packing sounds over all the yelling
as someone caught his breath and sprayed

GOATEED MAN
Ssstop

INT OFFICE PARK RESTAURANT  DAY

Jack eating lunch is served a refill soda by the BROKENNOSED WAITER
with a GOATEE the man from the above fight

JACK VO
Even if I could tell someone they had a good fight I wouldnt be
talking to the same man  Who you were in fight club is not who you
were in the rest of your world  You werent alive anywhere like you
were alive at fight club  But fight club only exists in the hours
between when fight club starts and when fight club ends

INT JACKS OFFICE  DAY

Boss passing by the doorway looks in at Jack with irritated wonder 
Jack playing solitaire on his computer daubs blood from his mouth
with a handkerchief

BOSS
What are you getting yourself into every week

PG 

Jack flashes a smile at Boss  Boss shakes his head walks away

JACK VO
After a night in fight club everything else in your life gets the
volume turned down  You can deal with anything  All the people who
used to have power over you have less and less

Reflexively Jacks tongue plays with his teeth

JACK VO
By this point I could wiggle most of the teeth in my jaw

INT BUS  DAY

Jack stands holding a hand grip  An arrogant MAN in a threepiece
suit brushes past him knockng his shoulder

JACK VO
We all started to size people up

Jack violently knocks the Mans shoulder in return  The Man turns and
he and Jack face each other for a brief moment  Jacks face is stone

JACK VO
Id look at some asshole and know I could beat him

The arrogant Man continues down the aisle  Jack notices a GUY with
SMASHED LIP  The Guy grins giving a slight nod

INT PARKING GARAGE  DAY FLASHBACK

Jack walks past the parking garage  He sees a VALET who has facial
bruises

JACK VO
We were all doing it

The Valet and Jack share a quick smile  A BMW pulls up and HONKS at
the Bruised Valet The bruised Valet has no reaction as a FAT EXEC gets
out of his car and tosses the keys  Jack watches the Bruised Valet
size up the Exec then hop into the car and loudly PEEL OUT

PG 

JACK VO
I would see them all the time  fight club members looking at other
guys knowing they could kick their asses

INT TAVERN BASEMENT  NIGHT

Jack lands a couple of jabs to HIS OPPONENTS stomach then brings up a
left uppercut that smashes the Opponents jaw  Tiny spatters of BLOOD
adorn the walls along with sweat

JACK VO
Fight club was not about winning or losing  It wasnt about words

The Opponent recovers throws a headlock on Jack  Jack snakes his arm
into a counter headlock  They wrestling like wild animals  The crowd
CHEERS maniacally

JACK VO
The hysterical shouting was in tongues like at a Pentecostal church

The onlookers kneel to stay with the fight cheering ever louder  The
Opponent smashes Jacks head into the floor over and over

JACK
Stop

Everyone moves in as the Opponent steps away  They lift Jack to his
feet  On the floor is a BLOOD MASK of Jacks face  similar to his
TEAR MASK on BOBS SHIRT seen earlier  Tyler pushes through the
crowd

TYLER

Jack and Tyler walk through the pools of light cast by streetlamps 
They both drip blood and sport bruises  They each carry a x piece of
WOOD  As they pass parked cars they SLAM the sticks against the front
bumpers setting off the ALARMS and causing the AIR BAGS to INFLATE

They come to a bus stop that has a large display ad for jeans  It has
a photo of a shirtless man

TYLER
Is that what a man looks like

JACK
Isnt it

Tyler smears blood on the ad  They continue on their way  Tyler comes
to a ROAD WORK sign  Tyler kicks it into a deep HOLE  He and Jack
tightropewalk on wooden beams over darkness

TYLER
Guys packing into the gyms all trying to look like what Calvin Klein
says  Fight club isnt about looking good

As they step back onto solid pavement Tyler kicks one of the beams
causing it to come loose and fall  The whole temporary work structure
falls into the hole  Tyler and Jack continue walking  IN the
background a car SKIDS and FISHTAILS avoiding the hole

Sound of a SIREN getting closer  Tyler hands Jack the x and runs
laughing  Jack stands there a moment then throws the stick and runs
after Tyler

JACK VO
A guy comes to fight club for the first time and his ass is a wad of
cookie dough  After a few weeks he looks carved out of wood  He
trusts himself to handle anything

EXT ANOTHER STREET  CONTINUOUS

Jack and Tyler panting sweat mixing with blood slow down and resume
walking  Tyler pulls his fingers popping them  his knuckles are

Jack sits at the table sipping coffee reading Readers Digest  He
takes in a long yawn rubs his eyes  He hears FOOTSTEPS approaching

JACK
Youre not going to believe the dream I had

Marla walks in straightening her dress  She looks like shes been
raped by a hurricane  Some of her hair is matted against her head
some of it is sticking out wildly  Jack gapes at her in shock  She
cracks a coy smile and runs a finger across the back of his neck

MARLA
I can hardly believe anything about last night

She pours herself a cup of coffee  She takes a big gulp GARGLES and
SPITS it out into the sink  She gives Jack a lascivious smile  Then
she sips from the cup  She strokes his hair  He pulls back from her

JACK
What the fuck are you doing here

Marla looks at him a beat then throws the cup into the sink and it
SHATTERS

MARLA
Fuck you

She kicks open the door to the backyard and walks out  Jack watches
her stomp across the lawn to the sidewalk and down the street

Jack turns and  Tyler is at his shoulder staring after Marla  Hes
in his usual sweatpants  He grins at Jack then moves away pours
himself coffee  Jack smoldering slumps at the table and picks up
Readers Digest  Tyler puts his foot on a countertop and begins to do
stretching exercises

they tapped it with a cold chisel to shatter the cylinder

JACK VO
I Am Joes Cold Sweat

And in fact cold sweat beads up on Jacks forehead  He scrubs his
pants obsessively

DETECTIVE STERN
The dynamite had a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium
perchloride  this means we can assume it was homemade

JACK
This is  really a shock to me Sir

DETECTIVE STERN
Whoever set the dynamite couldve turned on the gas and blown out the
pilot lights on the stove days before the explosion took place  The
gas was just the trigger

JACK
Who do you think did it

DETECTIVE STERN
Im asking the questions son

JACK
I loved my life  I loved that condo  I loved every stick of

snap at any moment and stalk from office to office with an Armalite
AR Carbine gasoperated semiautomatic  Hes probably at home every
night with a little rattail file filing a cross into the tip of every
one of his bullets  This way when he pumps a round into  someone
 it will split along the filed grooves and spread open the way a dum
dum flowers inside you to blow a load of guts out through someones
spine  This is probably somebody youve know for years

JACK
We need to talk

PG 

BOSS
Okay  Where to begin  With your constant absenteeism  With your
unpresentable appearance  I might as well tell you now  youre going
to be put up for review

This next line NOT in VO

JACK
I Am Joes Complete Lack Of Surprise

Boss sits up in his seat becoming enraged

JACK
Lets pretend  Youre the Department of Transportation  And you knew
that our company intentionally left a front seat mounting bracket that
never passed collision tests  Did nothing about leather seats  that
were cured in third world countries with a chemical we know causes
birth defects  Brake linings that fail after a thousand miles  
Turbochargers that blow up and cut off legs at the knees  Fuel
injectors that burn people alive  All of these accidents where cause
of failure is stamped unknown  I know where the bodies are buried 
Call it job security

BOSS
Just who the fuck do you think you are  Get out of here  Youre
fired

JACK
Ive got a better idea  Youre going to keep me on payroll as an
outside consultant  In exchange for my salary Ill perform the task
of not telling anyone what I know  I wont need to come into the
office  I can do this job from home  Call it early retirement with
pension

Boss stands moves around his desk glaring with rage

PG 

JACK
Yes I am shit and crazy to you and this whole fucking world but Im
your responsibility

Jack PUNCHES HIMSELF in the nose  Blood starts to trickle down  He
punches himself in the jaw harder  He throws himself back acting as
if the force of the punch knocked him  His back SLAMS against a framed
painting and SHATTERS the glass  He and the frame and the glass and
the painting fall to the floor

JACK VO
I Am Joes Smirking Revenge

JACK
Please dont hit me again  Please

Jack gets back to his feet and punches himself in the stomach then
punches himself in the jaw again  He reels backwards and falls into a
hanging shelf ripping it off the wall sending its contents flying 
He falls to the floor again

JACK VO
For some reason I thought of my first fight  with Tyler

Jack crawls along the carpet toward Boss dripping blood  He tries to
keep up the act but he sporadically GIGGLES  He grabs Bosss leg

JACK
Please  give me the paychecks like I asked for  You wont see me
again  You wont have any trouble

Jack climbs up Bosss leg  Boss aghast tries to shake him off and
in doing so stumbles back in to his desk knocking off photos stacks
of paper paperweights

JACK VO
Under and behind and inside everything this man took for granted
something horrible had been growing

Jack crawls up high enough to grab Bosss belt and hoist himself up
further  Hes getting blood all over the Bosss clothes  Jack SMUDGES
blood from his face onto the knuckles of both Bosss hands  The
horrified man SCREAMS

PG 

JACK VO
And right then at our most excellent moment security guards decided
to walk in

Two SECURITY GUARDS come inside and gape at the sight  Behind them
stands a crowd of curious workers also taking in the sight

an angelic face  He notices the TV

Jack looks at the TV as it shows a LIVE shot of a BUILDING which is
identified at the bottom of the screen as the TRW building  It has a
GIANT GRINNING FACE PAINTED on it  The two EYES are broken charred
windows with SMOKE pouring out  Firetrucks spray water into the
windows

REPORTER
Police Commissioner Jacobs has come down  just a second  excuse
me could you tell us what you think this is

The COMMISSIONER JACOBS a wrinkled man with baleful eyes turns to
camera

COMMISSIONER JACOBS
We believe this is related to the other recent acts of vandalism around
the city  Its some kind of organized group  And were investigating
thoroughly

Jack turns back and sees Tyler in the archway watching the TV  Tyler
pulls back out of sight  Jack turns to the others

JACK
What did you guys do

They all BURST INTO LAUGHTER look at Jack and shake their heads  Jack
just stares at them  Suddenly the guys faces turn to stone

inside  They hold him down and pull down his pants  Bob snaps a
rubber band then reaches down to Commissioner Jacobs crotch

TYLER
Wrap it around the top of his ball sac

Ricky holds a knife to Commissioner Jacobs testicles  Jack
redfaced keeps his distance  Tyler leans in and whispers in the
frightened mans ear

TYLER
Youre not going to continue your rigorous investigation  Youre
going to publicly state that there is no underground group  Or 
imagine the rest of your life with your ball sac flapping empty

COMMISSIONER JACOBS
No  Please  Stop  Please

TYLER
One to the New York Times and one to the Los Angeles Times  Press
release style  Remember this  The people youre after are everyone
you depend on  Were the people who do your laundry and cook your food
and serve your dinner  We guard you while you sleep  We drive the
ambulances  We process your insurance claims  We control every part
of your life  So dont fuck with us

Ricky makes a dramatic cut with the knife  he holds up the severed

the SHIT out of Angel Face with a viciousness heretofore unseen  The

everywhere  The crowd becomes QUIETER  Finally Angel Face on the
floor is clearly unconscious  Jack stops stares at him numb  The
crowd seems a little spooked  Tyler scans the faces looks at Jack

INT STOLEN CAR  MOVING  LATER

RAIN GUSHES down  Tyler drives  Jack sits slumped in the passenger
seat  They are BARRELING down a twolane HIGHWAY intermittently
illuminated by oncoming headlights  Jack stews in silence  Tyler
glances at him

TYLER
Whats the problem

JACK
Nothing  Why wasnt I told about Project Mayhem

TYLER
You were told about it

PG 

JACK
Uhhuh  Yeah  Fine  If you cant talk to me about it 

TYLER
Thats the whole point  you dont talk about it

JACK
So I cant even ask

TYLER
What do you want me to say  That Project Mayhem will knock over the
pillars of civilization like dominoes  That its going to bring about
a prematurelyinduced dark age  Should I Email you  Should I put
this on your action item list

JACK
Fine

TYLER
Recognize the make and model of this car

JACK
Yeah  so what

TYLER
The front seat mounting bracket never passed collision tests

Tyler pulls the car into the opposite lane  HEADLIGHTS in the distance
get closer very very quickly

JACK
What are you doing

The oncoming car gets closer and closer honking and flashing its
lights  Jack tries to grab the wheel  Tyler uses one arm to pin down
Jacks arms  He uses one hand to steer

JACK
TYLER  WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING

TYLER
If you died right now how would you feel about your life

JACK
I WOULD FEEL NOTHING ABOUT MY LIFE  IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR

PG 

TYLER
I want to hear the truth

The car swerves at the last second

JACK
Fuck my life  Fuck fight club  Fuck you and fuck Marla  Im sick of
this shit  Hows that  Huh

TYLER
You dont have any concept of what it is to hit bottom

An oncoming TRUCK honks and flashes its lights  It moves to the other
side of the road  Tyler steers there too  The truck moves back
Tyler moves back  More honking and flashing  The truck moves Tyler
moves

TYLER
HITTING BOTTOM ISNT A WEEKEND RETREAT  ITS NOT A SEMINAR  ONLY
AFTER YOUVE LOST EVERYTHING ARE YOU FREE TO DO ANYTHING  YOU SEE YOU
LISTEN BUT YOU DONT GET IT  YOU HAVE TO FORGET EVERYTHING YOU KNOW
EVERYTHING YOU THINK YOU KNOW

Just seconds to impact with the oncoming truck and  Tyler swerves 
Now the car heads straight for a STALLED CAR on the side of the road
surrounded by flares  Jack stops struggling to get his arms free

JACK
I am nothing in the world compared to you  I am helpless  I am stupid
and weak and all I do is want and need things  I am my little shit
job  I am my condo and my Swedish furniture  I am SHIT

Tyler lets go of Jacks arms and lets go of the steering wheel  He and
Jack look at each other as their car barrels toward the stalled car 
Their faces are illuminated by the light of the flares

They SMASH into the stalled car  Both airbags inflate but the front
seat LURCHES forward loose causing the mens legs to bang against the
dash  Tremendous momentum makes the back of the car whip around and
carry it into a assoverteakettle ROLL down the hill

PG 

JACK VO
Id never been in a car accident  This was what all those statistics
felt like before I wrote them into my reports

INT JACKS BEDROOM  LATE NIGHT

Jack lies in bed staring at the ceiling  Tyler sits in a chair next
to the bed speaking softly

TYLER
The world I see  youre stalking elk through the damp canyon forests
around the ruins of Rockefeller Center  You wear leather clothes that
will last you the rest of your life  You climb the wristthick vines
that wrap the Sears Tower  You see tiny figures pounding corn and
laying strips of venison on the empty car pool lane of the ruins of a
superhighway

Jack lies in bed staring at the ceiling  Tyler is gone  Faint sounds
of SAWING and HAMMERING

INT KITCHEN  MOMENTS LATER

Jack sits at the table sipping coffee  Hes pale dazed  He seems
broken  He hears the faint sounds of sawing and hammering again hes
unsure of where theyre coming from  He glances out the window sees
nothing

Marla walks into the kitchen  Jack looks up at her  She looks at him
unsmiling  Theres a bruise on her face and arm  She pours herself a
coffee and lights a cigarette  A beat of silence then

MARLA
Ill be out of your way in a sec

She seems to be as weak as Jack

JACK
You  dont have to  rush off

MARLA
Sarcastic prick

JACK
No really 

Marlas eyes drift away from his  Jack gets up tries to move closer
to her  She pulls away  He retreats and they wind up on opposite
sides of the room  Jack leans against the wall near the BASEMENT DOOR
which is AJAR

JACK
Why are we both  caught up like this  with 

JACK VO
I came so close to saying Tylers name I could feel it vibrate inside
my mouth

Marla looks at him curiously waiting

Why does a weak person go out and find a strong person to  hang
onto

MARLA
Its a real sick relationship  You dont think I know it

JACK
Does it have to be

PG 

MARLA
Does it

Faint sound of sawing and hammering  Jack cant quite figure where
its coming from

MARLA
We have to change the subject  Have we been talking too long

JACK
I just dont understand what you get out of such a sick relationship

MARLA
What the hell do you get out of it

Jack turns and sees through the slim space of the open door Tyler at
the bottom of the basement stairs staring a silent warning  Jack
turns back to Marla

JACK
Nevermind

MARLA
No  That day you came over to check my breast 

JACK
Lets just stop right here

MARLA
Come on  You want to pull yourself out of whatever youre stuck in

Marla moves slowly toward Jack

JACK
Conversation over

Marla strokes Jacks hair  She sees the kissscar on his hand  She
grabs his hand and studies it  Jack tries to pull it back but Marla
keeps a tight grip

PG 

MARLA

JACK
 A person

MARLA
Guy or girl

JACK
Why would you ask if its a guy or a girl

MARLA
Why would you get bent if I asked

MARLA
What does it mean  Youre afraid to say

JACK
Go  Go

Marla kisses Jacks hand putting her lips right onto the scar leaving
an imprint of lipstick  Jack jerks his hand away from her  He tries
to wipe off the lipstick and it smears  He unconsciously licks it off

MARLA
MMMMMMMMMM  Swallow it

JACK
Get the hell out of here

Stung Marla stomps toward the back door

MARLA
Go fuck yourself  thats probably how you like it best

Tyler steps back inside and shuts the door

JACK
Train here

TYLER
Hes not  If the applicant is young we tell him hes too young  Old

decaying organic matter as everything else  We are all part of the
same compost pile

Jack dips a spoon into the rice vat and chomps on some rice in an

shaped blasts  The tower crumbles straight down  Bob turns to smile
at Jack

BOB

The globe falls free bangs into the top of the hill and begins to
roll  When it gets to the street it bounces onto the top of a parked
LIMO  and becomes a FLAMING raised GUTTERBALL  it never hits the
street  it rolls over one parked limo or expensive luxury car after
another crunching the roofs causing the windows to explode outward 
Fifty cars get this treatment

Then it arrives at the lobby of a HOTEL BROADSIDES a couple of limos

as he runs  Underneath are street clothes

In that moment I clicked  I became what Tyler wanted  I was his
limb his appendage  an extension of his will nothing more  And he
knew it  I could feel him knowing it

Jack dumps the wad of clothes into a trashcan and pulls up the
surrounding trash to cover them  He breaks into a sprint again

breath  The Cop looks up and catches sight of Jack  He lifts his gun
and his PB radio  Jack jerks back out of sight

PG 

JACK

TYLER
Theyre all up and down the building  Theyre not just here  If you
tried to stupidly pull a fuse on a charge youd just cause it to blow
up  The charges are set to go in a specific order  so that the
building will implode and collapse  If you did defuse one of the
charges youd fuck up the sequence and the building might fall the
wrong way  Why dont you just find a television and watch the party

JACK
Im awake  I have control of the body  You cant give orders

TYLER
I dont have any orders left to give  Its all set

Jack boils over then cracks  He drops the gun falls to his knees and
clutches at Tyler  He touches Tylers face

RESUME NORMAL SPEED as Tyler gapes at Jack then reaches behind his
head and feels  theres a HOLE BLOWN OUT THE BACK  Tylers eyes
glaze over and he falls backwards plopping on the floor DEAD with a
grin on his face

side of his face where hes SHOT A HOLE through HIS CHEEK  He stares
at the empty floor in front of him with his weird little smile

TALL SPACE MONKEY

The two Space Monkeys who hold Marla press forward through the crowd 
One of them puts a GUN to her head  He COCKS it

TALL SPACE MONKEY

Jack takes in the sight of Marla and the gun at her head  He cracks a
Tyleresque grin

JACK

The Monkeys release Marla  She moves next to Jack now becoming more
shocked by his bloody state  Jack grabs her arm  She digs through her
purse and pulls out a wad of tissue paper  She puts them into his
mouth to plug the hole

Jack cracks his weird little smile his eyes are wide and
halfinsanelooking  He winks at Marla and squeezes her hand

Marla looks at Jack then looks back out the window  He reaches for
her hand  She takes his hand
