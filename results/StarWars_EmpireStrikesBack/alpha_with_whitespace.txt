EXT GALAXY  PLANET HOTH

A Star Destroyer moves through space releasing Imperial probe robots 
from its underside  

One of these probes zooms toward the planet Hoth and lands on its ice
covered surface  An explosion marks the point of
impact  

EXT HOTH  METEORITE CRATER  SNOW PLAIN  DAY

A weird mechanical sound rises above the whining of the wind  A 
strange probe robot with several extended sensors emerges from the 
smokeshrouded crater  The ominous mechanical probe floats across the 
snow plain and disappears into the distance

EXT PLAIN OF HOTH  DAY

A small figure gallops across the windswept ice slope  The bundled 
rider is mounted on a large gray snow lizard a Tauntaun  Curving 
plumes of snow rise from beneath the speeding paws of the twolegged 
beast

The rider gallops up a slope and reins his lizard to a stop  Pulling 
off his protective goggles Luke Skywalker notices something in the 
sky  He takes a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt and 
through them sees smoke rising from where the probe robot has crashed

The wind whips at Lukes furlined cap and he activates a comlink 
transmitter  His Tauntaun shifts and moans nervously beneath him

				LUKE
			into comlink
		Echo Three to Echo Seven  Han 
		old buddy do you read me

After a little static a familiar voice is heard

				HAN
			over comlink
		Loud and clear kid  Whats up

				LUKE
			into comlink
		Well I finished my circle  I 
		dont pick up any life readings

				HAN
			over comlink
		There isnt enough life on this 
		ice cube to fill a space cruiser  
		The sensors are placed Im going 
		back

				LUKE
			into comlink
		Right  Ill see you shortly  
		Theres a meteorite that hit the 
		ground near here  I want to check 
		it out  It wont take long

Luke clicks off his transmitter and reins back on his nervous lizard  
He pats the beast on the head to calm it

				LUKE
		Hey steady girl  Whats the 
		matter  You smell something

Luke takes a small device from his belt and starts to adjust it when 
suddenly a large shadow falls over him from behind  He hears a 
monstrous howl and turns to see an elevenfoottall shape towering over 
him  It is a Wampa Ice Creature lunging at him ferociously

				LUKE
		Aaargh

Luke grabs for his pistol but is hit flat in the face by a huge white 
claw  He falls unconscious into the snow and in a moment the terrified 
screams of the Tauntaun are cut short by the horrible snap of a neck 
being broken

The Wampa Ice Creature grabs Luke by one ankle and drags him away 
across the frozen plain

EXT HOTH  REBEL BASE ENTRANCE  DAY

A stalwart figure rides his Tauntaun up to the entrance of an enormous 
ice cave

INT HOTH  REBEL BASE  MAIN HANGAR DECK

Rebel troopers rush about unloading supplies and otherwise securing 
their new base  The rider Han Solo swings off his lizard and pulls 
off his goggles

He walks into the main hangar deck toward the Millennium Falcon which 
is parked among several fighters  Mechanics R units and various 
other droids hurry about  Han stops at the Millennium Falcon where his 
Wookiee copilot Chewbacca is welding on a central lifter  Chewie 
stops his work and lifts his face shield growling an irritated 
greeting to his boss

				HAN
		Chewie

The Wookiee grumbles a reply

				HAN
		All right dont lose your temper
		Ill come right back and give you 
		a hand

Chewbacca puts his mask back on and returns to his welding as Han 
leaves

INT HOTH  REBEL BASE  COMMAND CENTER

A makeshift command center has been set up in a blasted area of thick 
ice  The lowceilinged room is a beehive of activity Controllers 
troops and droids move about setting up electronic equipment and 
monitoring radar signals

General Rieekan straightens up from a console at Hans approach

				RIEEKAN
		Solo

				HAN
No sign of life out there General
The sensors are in place  Youll 
know if anything comes around

				RIEEKAN
		Commander Skywalker reported in yet

				HAN
		No  Hes checking out a meteorite 
		that hit near him

				RIEEKAN
			indicates radar 
			 screen
		With all the meteor activity in this
		system its going to be difficult 
		to spot approaching ships

Taking a deep breath Han blurts out what is on his mind

				HAN
		General Ive got to leave  I 
		cant stay anymore

Princess Leia standing at a console nearby is dressed in a short 
white combat jacket and pants  Her hair is braided across her head in 
a Nordic fashion  She overhears their  conversation and seems somewhat 
distressed

				RIEEKAN
		Im sorry to hear that

				HAN
		Well theres a price on my head
		If I dont pay off Jabba the Hut 
		Im a dead man

				RIEEKAN
		A death marks not an easy thing 
		to live with  Youre a good
		fighter Solo  I hate to lose you

				HAN
		Thank you General

He turns to Leia as Rieekan moves away

				HAN
			with feeling
		Well Your Highness I guess this 
		is it

				LEIA
		Thats right

Leia is angry  Han sees she has no warmth to offer him  He shakes his 
head and adopts a sarcastic tone

				HAN
			cooly
		Well dont get all mushy on me
		So long Princess

Han walks away into the quiet corridor adjoining the command center  
Leia stews a moment then hurries after him

INT HOTH  REBEL BASE  ICE CORRIDOR

				LEIA
		Han

Han stops in the corridor and turns to face Leia

				HAN
		Yes Your Highnessness

				LEIA
		I thought you decided to stay

				HAN
		Well the bounty hunter we ran 
		into on Ord Mantell changed my
		mind  

				LEIA
		Han we need you

				HAN
		We

				LEIA
		Yes

				HAN
		Oh what about you need

				LEIA
			mystified
		I need  I dont know what youre 
		talking about

				HAN
			shakes his head 
			 fed up 
		You probably dont

				LEIA
		And what precisely am I supposed 
		to know

				HAN
		Come on  You want me to stay 
		because of the way you feel about
		me

				LEIA
		Yes  Youre a great help to us
		Youre a natural leader

				HAN
		No  Thats not it  Come on  
		Aahhh  uh huh  Come on

Leia stares at him understanding then laughs

				LEIA
Youre imagining things

				HAN
		Am I  Then why are you following 
		me  Afraid I was going to leave
		without giving you a goodbye kiss

				LEIA
		Id just as soon kiss a Wookiee

				HAN
		I can arrange that  You could use 
		a good kiss

Angrily Han strides down the corridor as Leia stares after him

INT HOTH  REBEL BASE  ANOTHER ICE CORRIDOR

A familiar stream of beeps and whistles herald the approach of Artoo
Detoo and SeeThreepio who appear around a corner and move along an 
ice wall toward the main hangar

				THREEPIO
		Dont try to blame me  I didnt 
		ask you to turn on the thermal 
		heater  I merely commented that it 
		was freezing in the princess 
		chamber  But its supposed to be 
		freezing  How are we going to dry 
		out all her clothes  I really dont 
		know

Artoo beeps a stream of protesting whistles

				THREEPIO
		Oh switch off

INT HOTH  REBEL BASE  MAIN HANGAR DECK

The two robots stop at Han Solos space freighter  Han and Chewie are 
struggling with their central lifters

				HAN
			to Chewie
		Why do you take this apart now 
		Im trying to get us out of here 
		and you pull both of these

Chewie grumbles in irritation

				THREEPIO
		Excuse me sir

				HAN
			to Chewie
		Put them back together right now

				THREEPIO
		Might I have a word with you 
		please

				HAN
		What do you want

				THREEPIO
		Well its Princess Leia sir
		Shes been trying to get you on 
		the communicator

				HAN
		I turned it off  I dont want to 
		talk to her

				THREEPIO
		Oh  Well Princess Leia is wondering 
		about Master Luke  He hasnt come 
		back yet  She doesnt know where he 
		is

				HAN
		I dont know where he is

				THREEPIO
		Nobody knows where he is

				HAN
		What do you mean nobody knows

Han glances at the fading light at the entrance of the ice cave as 
night slowly begins to fall on the planet

				THREEPIO
		Well uh you see

Han jumps down off the lift as Threepio follows him

				HAN
		Deck Officer  Deck Officer

				THREEPIO
		Excuse me sir  Might I inqu

Han abruptly puts his hand over Threepios mouth as the deck officer 
approaches

				DECK OFFICER
		Yes sir

				HAN
		Do you know where Commander 
		Skywalker is

				DECK OFFICER
		I havent seen him  Its possible 
		he came in through the south entrance

				HAN
		Its possible  Why dont you go 
		find out  Its getting dark out there

				DECK OFFICER
		Yes sir

The deck officer leaves hurriedly as Han takes his hand off Threepios 
mouth

				THREEPIO
		Excuse me sir  Might I inquire 
		whats going on

				HAN
		Why not

				THREEPIO
		Impossible man  Come along Artoo 
		lets find Princess Leia  Between 
		ourselves I think Master Luke is 
		in considerable danger

INT HOTH  REBEL BASE  MAIN ICE TUNNEL

The deck officer and his assistant hurry toward Han as he enters the 
tunnel

				DECK OFFICER
		Sir Commander Skywalker hasnt 
		come in through the south entrance
		He might have forgotten to check in

				HAN
		Not likely  Are the speeders ready

				DECK OFFICER
		Not yet  Were having some trouble 
		adapting them to the cold

				HAN
		Then well have to go out on 
		Tauntauns

				DECK OFFICER
		Sir the temperatures dropping too 
		rapidly

				HAN
		Thats right  And my friends out 
		in it

				ASSISTANT OFFICER
		Ill cover sector twelve  Have 
		comcontrol set screen alpha

Han pushes through the troops and mounts a Tauntaun

				DECK OFFICER
		Your Tauntaunll freeze before you 
		reach the first marker

				HAN
		Then Ill see you in hell

Han maneuvers his mount out of the cave and races into the dark bitter 
night

EXT HOTH  ICE GORGE  DUSK

The jagged face of a huge ice wall sits gloomily in the dim twilight of 
a Hoth day  Luke hangs upside down ankles frozen into icy 
stalactites his extended arms within a foot of the snow floor  One 
side of his face is covered in a dried mask of frozen blood  He opens 
his eyes as a chilling moan of the hideous ice creature echoes off the 
gorge walls  Luke pulls himself up grabs hold of his ankles and 
futilely tries to unfasten the throngs

Exhausted he drops back into his hanging position  As he hangs there 
he spies his lightsaber lying near a pile of his discarded gear about 
three feet out of reach

He focuses on the saber and as his hand strains toward the weapon he 
squeezes his eyes tight in concentration

Just as the ice creature looms over Luke the lightsaber jumps into 
Lukes hand

The young warrior instantly ignites his sword swinging up and cuts 
himself loose from the ice  He flops to the snow in a heap  The 
startled creature moves back his giant yellow eyes blinking  Luke 
scrambles to his feet  He swings his lightsaber and the beast screams 
in pain

EXT HOTH  ENTRANCE TO ICE GORGE  DUSK

Luke staggers out of the gorge into the dark and snowy twilight  Weak 
and exhausted he stumbles down a snow bank

EXT HOTH  SNOW PLAIN  DUSK

A small lone figure riding a Tauntaun races through the hostile 
vastness of snow and cold  As it runs the Tauntauns legs kick up 
large clouds of snow and ice into the snowy air

EXT HOTH  OUTSIDE ICE				 HANGAR  DUSK

Artoo stands in the falling snow beeping worriedly  Threepio moves 
stiffly over to him

				THREEPIO
		You must come along now Artoo  
		Theres really nothing more we can 
		do  And my joints are freezing up

Artoo beeps long and low

				THREEPIO
		Dont say thing like that  Of 
		course well see Master Luke again
		Hell be quite all right youll see
			to himself
		Stupid little shortcircuit  Hell 
		be quite all right

Threepio turns to go back inside the main hangar as Artoo mournfully 
keeps his vigil

EXT HOTH  SNOW DRIFT  DUSK

The wind is blowing quite strong now  Luke struggles to stay upright 
but a blast of freezing snow knocks him over  He struggles to get up 
but he cant  The young warrior from Tatooine drags himself a couple 
of feet and then collapses

INT REBEL BASE  MAIN HANGAR DECK  ENTRANCE  NIGHT

Princess Leia stands inside the dark entrance to the Rebel base 
waiting for a sign of the two Rebel heroes  She shivers in the cold 
wind as nearby Chewie sits with his head in his hands  In the 
background Artoo and Threepio move through the doors  

A Rebel lieutenant moves to Major Derlin an officer keeping watch with 
the princess

				LIEUTENANT
		Sir all the patrols are in
		Theres still no contact from 
		Skywalker or Solo

				THREEPIO
		Mistress Leia Artoo says hes been 
		quite unable to pick up any signals 
		although he does admit that his own 
		range is far too weak to abandon 
		all hope

Leia nods an acknowledgment but she is lost in thought

				DERLIN
		Your Highness theres nothing 
		more we can do tonight  The shield 
		doors must be closed

He turns to the lieutenant

				DERLIN
		Close the doors

				LIEUTENANT
		Yes sir

The lieutenant walks away  Chewie lets out a long mournful howl 
somewhat like a coyote  At the same moment Artoo begins a complex 
series of efficient beeps

				THREEPIO
		Artoo says the chances of survival 
		are seven hundred seventyfive
		to one

Leia stands praying to herself as the huge metal doors slam across the 
entrance of the ice cave  The loud booms echo throughout the huge 
cavern  Chewie lets out another suffering howl

				THREEPIO
		Actually Artoo has been known to 
		make mistakes from time to time
		Oh dear oh dear  Dont worry 
		about Master Luke  Im sure hell 
		be all right  Hes quite clever 
		you know for a human being

EXT HOTH  SNOW DRIFT  DUSK

Luke lies face down in the snow nearly unconscious  Slowly he looks 
up and sees Ben Kenobi barely visible through the blowing snow  It is 
hard to tell if Kenobi is real or a hallucination

				BEN
		Luke Luke

				LUKE
			weakly
		Ben

				BEN
		You will go to the Dagobah system

				LUKE
		Dagobah system

				BEN
		There you will learn from Yoda 
		the Jedi Master who instructed me

The image of Ben fades revealing a lone Tauntaun rider approaching 
from the windswept horizon

				LUKE
			groaning faintly
		Ben Ben

Luke drops into unconsciousness

Han pulls up and leaps off his mount  He hurries to his snowcovered 
friend cradling him in his arms  Hans Tauntaun lets out a low 
pitiful bellow  But Hans concern is with Luke and he shakes him 
urgently

				HAN
		Luke  Luke  Dont do this Luke  
		Come on give me a sign here

Luke doesnt respond  Han begins frantically rubbing and slapping 
Lukes unconscious face  As he starts to lift the youth Han hears a 
rasping sound behind him  He turns just in time to see his Tauntaun 
stagger and then fall over into the snow

Han carries Luke to the moaning beast  Then with a final groan the 
Tauntaun expires

				HAN 
		Not much time

He pushes Lukes inert form against the belly of the dead beast

				LUKE
			moaning
		Ben Ben

				HAN
		Hang on kid

				LUKE
		Dagobah system

Han ignites Lukes saber and cuts the beast from head to toe  He 
quickly tosses its steaming innards into the snow then lifts Lukes 
inert form and stuffs him inside the carcass

				HAN
			reeling from the 
			 odor 
		Whew

				LUKE
		Dagobah

				HAN
		This may smell bad kid

				LUKE
			moaning
		Yoda

				HAN
		but it will keep you warm 
		til I get the shelter built
			struggling to get 
			 Luke inside the 
			 carcass 
		Ooh I thought they smelled bad 
		on the outside

The wind has picked up considerably making it difficult to move  Han 
removes a pack from the dead creatures back taking out a shelter 
container  He begins to set up what can only be a pitiful protection 
against a bitter Hoth night

EXT HOTH  SNOWDRIFT  DAWN

Four snubnosed armored snowspeeders race across the white landscape

INT SNOWSPEEDER COCKPIT

There is only one pilot Zev in the enclosed twoman craft  He 
concentrates on the scopes which ring his cockpit  He hears a low beep 
from one of his monitors

				ZEV
			into transmitter 
		Echo Base Ive got something  Not 
		much but it could be a life form

EXT HOTH  SNOWDRIFT

The small craft banks and makes a slow arc then races off in a new 
direction

INT SNOWSPEEDER  COCKPIT

The pilot switches over to a new transmitter

				ZEV
			into transmitter
		This is Rogue Two  this is Rogue 
		Two  Captain Solo so you copy  
		Commander Skywalker do you copy 
		This is Rogue Two

There is a sharp crackle of static then a faint voice

				HAN
			filtered over 
			 Zevs receiver
		Good morning  Nice of you guys 
		to drop by

				ZEV
			switching transmitters 
		Echo Base this is Rogue Two  I 
		found them  Repeat I found them

EXT HOTH  SNOWDRIFT  DAY

The small shelter Han set up is covered with snow on the windward side  
A makeshift antenna rests gingerly on top the snowdrift  Han spots 
Zevs snowspeeder approaching in the distance and begins waving his 
arms frantically at the tiny craft

INT REBEL BASE  MEDICAL CENTER

Strange robot surgeons adjust a mass of electronic equipment  A switch 
is thrown and a sudden blinding flash obscures Luke in a bacta tank 
filled with a thick gelatinous slime  He begins to thrash about 
raving in delirium

INT REBEL BASE  MEDICAL CENTER  RECOVERY ROOM

Luke sits up in a recoveryroom bed weak but smiling  His face shows 
terrible wounds from the Wampas attack  Threepio and Artoo enter the 
room

				THREEPIO
		Master Luke sir its so good 
		to see you fully functional again

Artoo beeps his good wishes

				THREEPIO
		Artoo expresses his relief also

Han and Chewie make their entrance  The Wookiee growls a greeting

				HAN
		How are you feeling kid  You 
		dont look so bad to me  In 
		fact you look strong enough to 
		pull the ears off a Gundark

				LUKE
		Thanks to you

				HAN
		Thats two you owe me junior

Han turns as Leia enters the room  He looks at her with a big 
devilish grin

				HAN
		Well your Worship looks like 
		you managed to keep me around for
		a little while longer

				LEIA
			haughtily
		I had nothing to do with it  General 
		Rieekan thinks its dangerous for 
		any ships to leave the system until 
		weve activated the energy shield

				HAN
		Thats a good story  I think you 
		just cant bear to let a gorgeous 
		guy like me out of your sight

				LEIA
		I dont know where you get your 
		delusions laser brain

Chewie is amused he laughs in his manner  Han enjoying himself 
regards Chewie goodhumoredly

				HAN
		Laugh it up fuzzball  But you 
		didnt see us alone in the south 
		passage

Luke sparks to this he looks at Leia

				HAN
		She expressed her true feelings 
		for me

Leia is flushed eyes darting between Luke and Han

				LEIA
		My  Why you stuck up half
		witted scruffylooking nerf
		herder

				HAN
		Whos scruffylooking 
			to Luke 
		I must have hit pretty close to 
		the mark to get her all riled up 
		like that huh kid

Leia looks vulnerable for a moment then the mask falls again and she 
focuses on Luke

				LEIA
		Why I guess you dont know 
		everything about women yet

With that she leans over and kisses Luke on the lips  Then she turns 
on her heel and walks out leaving everyone in the room slightly 
dumbstruck  With some smugness Luke puts his hands behind his head 
and grins

Suddenly in the distance the muffled sound of an alarm is heard

				ANNOUNCER
			over loudspeaker
		Headquarters personnel report to 
		command center

The voice repeats the order and Han Chewie Artoo and Threepio hurry 
out of the room bidding farewell to Luke

				HAN
		Take it easy

				THREEPIO
		Excuse us please

INT HOTH  REBEL BASE  COMMAND CENTER

Rieekan looks up grimly from a console screen  He calls over to Leia 
and Han

				RIEEKAN
		Princess we have a visitor

The group hurries over to Rieekan

				RIEEKAN
		Weve picked up something outside 
		the base in zone twelve moving 
		east

				SENIOR CONTROLLER
		Its metal

				LEIA
		Then it couldnt be one of those 
		creatures that attacked Luke

				HAN
		It could be a speeder one of ours

				SENIOR CONTROLLER
		No  Wait  theres something very 
		weak coming through

Threepio steps up to the control panel and listens intently to the 
strange signal

				THREEPIO
		Sir I am fluent in six million 
		forms of communication  This signal 
		is not used by the Alliance  It 
		could be an Imperial code

The transmission ends in static

				HAN
		It isnt friendly whatever it is  
		Come on Chewie lets check it out

				RIEEKAN
		Send Rogues Ten and Eleven to 
		station threeeight

EXT HOTH  SNOW PLAIN  DAY

The dark probe robot moves past the smoldering ruins of station three
eight and down a ridge toward the Rebel base  It raises a large 
antenna from the top of its head and begins to send out a piercing 
signal

The probe droid has spotted Chewbacca who not thirty feet away has 
popped his head over a snow bank  Instantly the probe robot swings 
around its deadly ray ready to fire  But before it can get a shot 
off it is hit from behind by a laser bolt and explodes in a million 
pieces

Han Solo replaces his blaster in its holster and peers intently at the 
smoldering remains of the Imperial probe

INT HOTH  REBEL BASE  COMMAND CENTER

Leia and Rieekan listen to Han on the comlink

				HAN
			over comlink
		Afraid theres not much left

				LEIA
			into comlink
		What was it

				HAN
			over comlink
		Droid of some kind  I didnt hit 
		it that hard  It must have had a 
		selfdestruct

				LEIA
			into comlink
		An Imperial probe droid

				HAN
			over comlink
		Its a good bet the Empire knows 
		were here

				RIEEKAN
		Wed better start the evacuation

EXT SPACE  IMPERIAL FLEET

Darth Vaders Star Destroyer larger and more awesome than the five 
Imperial Star Destroyers that surround it sits in the vastness of 
space  The six huge ships are surrounded by a convoy of smaller 
spacecraft  TIE fighters dart to and fro

INT DARTH VADERS STAR DESTROYER  BRIDGE  MAIN CONTROL DECK

Controllers working the vast complex of electronic controls hear 
ominous approaching footsteps and look up from their controls  The 
squat evillooking Admiral Ozzel and the young powerfully built 
General Veers who have been conferring near the front also feel the 
approaching presence and turn toward it  Darth Vader Lord of the 
Sith enters like a chill wind  As Vader moves across the wide bridge 
Captain Piett hurries up to Ozzel

				PIETT
		Admiral

				OZZEL
		Yes Captain

				PIETT
		I think weve got something sir  
		The report is only a fragment from 
		a probe droid in the Hoth system 
		but its the best lead weve had

				OZZEL
			irritated 
		We have thousands of probe droids 
		searching the galaxy  I want proof 
		not leads

				PIETT
		The visuals indicate life readings

				OZZEL
		It could mean anything  If we 
		followed every lead

				PIETT
		But sir the Hoth system is supposed 
		to be devoid of human forms

Vader moves to a large screen showing an image of the Rebel snow base  
Rebel speeders can be seen approaching the base in the distance

				VADER
		You found something

				PIETT
		Yes my lord

				VADER
			studying the image 
			 on the console screen 
		Thats it  The Rebels are there

				OZZEL
		My lord there are so many uncharted 
		settlements  It could be smugglers 
		it could be

		That is the system  And Im sure 
		Skywalker is with them  Set your

		Veers prepare you men

INT HOTH  REBEL BASE  TRANSPORT BAY

A captain issues instructions to two of his men at the entrance to the 
main transport bay  Several Rebel transports behind them are being 
loaded by men carrying heavy boxes and moving quickly but not in 
panic

				REBEL CAPTAIN
		Groups seven and ten will stay 
		behind to fly the speeders  As 
		soon as each transport is loaded

				REBEL FIGHTER
		Right sir

INT HOTH  REBEL BASE  MAIN HANGAR DECK

Alarms sound  Troops ground crews and droids rush to their alert 
stations  Armored snowspeeders are lined up in attack formation near 
the main entrance

In the midst of all this activity Han does some frantic welding on the 
lifters of the Millennium Falcon

Han finishes his work and hops down to the hangar floor  He pulls out 
his comlink all the while eyeing problematic lifters

				HAN
			into comlink to 
			 Chewie
		Okay thats it  Try it Off 
		Turn it off  Turn it off  Off

Smoke rises from a minor explosion on the lifter  Exasperated Han 
surveys the new damage

INT REBEL BASE  MEDICAL CENTER

Luke dresses in readiness for the evacuation as his attending medical 
droid stands by

				MEDICAL DROID
		Sir it will take quite a while 
		to evacuate the Tforty sevens

				LUKE
		Well forget the heavy equipment
		Theres plenty of time to get the 
		smaller modules on the transports

				MEDICAL DROID
		Take care sir

				LUKE
		Thanks

INT REBEL BASE  MAIN HANGAR DECK

Pilots gunners and R units scurry about  Luke pulling on his 
heavyweather jacket is headed toward a row of armored speeders  He 
stops at the rear of the Millennium Falcon where Han and Chewie are 
trying to repair the right lifter with even more haste than before

				LUKE
		Chewie take care of yourself 
		okay

As Luke pats Chewie on the arm Chewie puts his arms around Luke and 
gives him a tight hug  Han is discussing the lifter with a repair 
droid when he sees Luke

				HAN
		Hi kid
			to droid
		Theres got to be a reason for 
		it  Check it at the other end
		Wait a second
			to Luke
		You all right

				LUKE
		Yeah

				HAN
		Be careful

				LUKE
		You too

Luke smiles then waves at his friend and walks on  After a few steps 
he stops and looks back  Han glances up and the two exchange a silent 
communication each wishing the other safety happiness  many things 
all difficult to verbalize

INT REBEL BASE  CONTROL ROOM

Alarms sound throughout the hidden Rebel base  In the control room a 
controller urgently gestures for General Rieekan to check a computer 
scan

				CONTROLLER
		General theres a fleet of Star 
		Destroyers coming out of hyperspace 
		in sector four

				RIEEKAN
		Reroute all power to the energy 
		shield  Weve got to hold them till 
		all transports are away  Prepare 
		for ground assault

Rieekan exits hurriedly

INT VADERS STAR DESTROYER  VADERS CHAMBER  MEDITATION CUBICLE

The dark cubicle is illuminated by a single shaft of light which falls 
on the brooding Dark Lord as he sits on a raised meditation cube  
General Veers enters the room and approaches the silent unmoving 
Vader  Although seemingly very sure of himself Veers is still not 
bold enough to interrupt the meditating lord  The younger general 
stands quietly at attention until the evil presence speaks

				VADER
		What is it General

				VEERS
		My lord the fleet has moves out 
		of lightspeed  ComScan has 
		detected an energy field protecting 
		an area around the sixth planet of 
		the Hoth system  The field is 
		strong enough to deflect any 
		bombardment

				VADER
			angrily
		The Rebels are alerted to our 
		presence  Admiral Ozzel came out 
		of lightspeed too close to the 
		system

				VEERS
		He felt surprise was wiser

				VADER
		He is as clumsy as he is stupid
		General prepare your troops for a 
		surface attack

				VEERS
		Yes my lord

Veers turns smartly and leaves as Vader activates a large viewscreen 
showing the bridge of his mighty ship  Admiral Ozzel appears on the 
viewscreen standing slightly in front of Captain Piett

				OZZEL
		Lord Vader the fleet has moved 
		out of lightspeed and were 
		preparing to Aaagh

				VADER
		You have failed me for the last 
		time Admiral  Captain Piett

Piett steps forward as the admiral moves away slightly confused 
touching his throat as it begins to constrict painfully

				PIETT
		Yes my lord

				VADER
Make ready to land out troops beyond

him  He looks up at the underbelly of the huge walker passing 
overhead

Running beneath the monstrous machine Luke fires his harpoon gun at 
the walkers underside  A thin cable follows the projectile from the 
gun  The magnetic head and cable attach firmly to the metal hull

Still running under the walker Luke attaches the cable drum to his 
belt buckle  Soon he is pulled up the cable and hangs dangling 
underneath the walker

The walkers giant feet continue to pound onward across the frozen 
snow  Stray laser bolts whistle by Luke as he climbs up the cable to 
the walkers hull reaching a small hatch  Hanging precariously Luke 
cuts the solid metal hatch with his laser sword

He takes a landmine from around his neck and throws it inside the 
Imperial machine  Quickly Luke starts down the cable and crashes onto 
the icy ground far below  He lies unconscious as a giant rear leg 
passes by  and just misses him

within  and then the walkers mechanical insides  are spewed out every

				HAN
		Oww  Chewie

More turbulence rocks the ship

				HAN
		That was no laser blast  Something 
		hit us

				LEIA
			over comlink
		Han get up here

				HAN
		Come on Chewie

Han climbs out of the hold like a shot  Both he and Chewie run out of 
the hold and toward the cockpit

INT MILLENNIUM FALCON  COCKPIT

Out the front cockpit window they see hundreds of asteroids racing by

				LEIA
		Asteroids

Han changes places with Leia who has been at the controls and Chewie 
gets into his chair  Han works his controls as a chunk of rock crosses 
in front of the ship

				HAN
		Oh no  Chewie set twoseven
		one

				LEIA
		What are you doing  Youre not 
		actually going into an asteroid 
		field

				HAN
		Theyd be crazy to follow us 
		wouldnt they

Another asteroid thumps against the ship and Leia winces at the jolt

				LEIA
		You dont have to do this to 
		impress me

				THREEPIO
		Sir the possibility of successfully 
		navigating an asteroid field is 
		approximately three thousand seven 
		hundred and twenty to one

				HAN
		Never tell me the odds

EXT ASTEROID BELT  MILLENNIUM FALCON

The Falcon turns into the asteroid storm and as the ship completes its 
turn asteroids start coming straight at the cockpit windows

A large asteroid tumbles away from the Falcons path at top speed  
Several smaller asteroids crash into the big one creating small 
explosions on its surface  Other asteroids of all sizes pass by in 
every direction some colliding and exploding  The tiny Millennium 
Falcon veers around the big asteroid and races past it through the rain 
of rocks followed by four TIE fighters which bob and weave around the 
asteroids

One of the pursuing TIE fighters connects with an asteroid and 
explodes  The other fighters are pelted with a steady stream of 
smaller explosions

Two huge asteroids tumble toward the Millennium Falcon which quickly 
banks around both of them  The three TIE fighters follow in hot 
pursuit until one of the fighters scrapes an asteroid and tumbles out 
of control into deep space

EXT SPACE  STAR DESTROYER  ASTEROID BELT

The massive Star Destroyer blasts oncoming asteroids as it follows the 
Falcon  Smaller asteroids explode across its vast surface

EXT MILLENNIUM FALCON  TIE FIGHTERS  ASTEROID BELT

The Falcon twists on its side as it races around an oncoming asteroid  
Two TIE fighters follow in the distance coming from either side

INT MILLENNIUM FALCON  COCKPIT

Asteroids race by the cockpit window as Han pilots his trusty craft 
through the dangerous field

Looking out the cockpit window the Falcon crew sees a big asteroid 
drop past the window narrowly missing their ship

Chewie barks in terror as a slightly smaller asteroid comes especially 
close  to close  and bounces off the Falcon with a loud crunch  
Threepios hands cover his eyes  He manages a short peek at the 
cockpit window  Princess Leia sits stonefaced staring at the action  
Han gives her a quick look

				HAN
		You said you wanted to be around 
		when I made a mistake well this 
		could be it sweetheart

				LEIA
		I take it back  Were going to 
		get pulverized if we stay out here 
		much longer

The group watches as more asteroids race by outside the window

				HAN
		Im not going to argue with that

				THREEPIO
		Pulverized

				HAN
		Im going in closer to one of 
		those big ones

				LEIA
		Closer

				THREEPIO
		Closer

Chewbacca barks the same word only louder

EXT MILLENNIUM FALCON  ASTEROID BELT

The Millennium Falcon dives toward the surface of one of the moonsized 
asteroids  There is a continued display of explosions against the 
starry void as smaller asteroids collide with larger chunks of rock  
The two remaining TIE fighters follow the Falcon to the large asteroid  
The Falcon skims the surface of the giant asteroid as all the while 
small asteroids explode on the surface of the ship

The TIE fighters approach the Falcon but a giant asteroid hurtles 
directly into their path  As the asteroid continues on its way it 
leaves remains of the two exploded TIE fighters to tumble into deep 
space

INT MILLENNIUM FALCON  COCKPIT

Rattled by the violent rocking of the starship Threepio is nearly in 
hysterics

				THREEPIO
		Oh this is suicide

Han notices something on his main scope and nudges his faithful 
Wookiee pointing

				HAN
		There  That looks pretty good

				LEIA
		What looks pretty good

				HAN
		Yeah  Thatll do nicely

				THREEPIO
			to Leia
		Excuse me maam but where are 
		we going

Out the cockpit window they see that they are skimming the surface of 
the enormous asteroid and nearing a large crater

EXT MILLENNIUM FALCON  GIANT ASTEROID CRATER

The Millennium Falcon dives into the huge crater and disappears

INT MILLENNIUM FALCON  COCKPIT

				LEIA
		I hope you know what youre doing

				HAN
		Yeah me too

INT GIANT ASTEROID CRATER

The Falcon races down into the crater  The walls are barely visible as 
the ship speed through the tunnellike opening  A small cave appears on 
one side of the crater and the Falcon turns slows and scoots into 
it

EXT SPACE   LUKES XWING

The tiny Xwing speeds toward the cloud cover of Dagobah  Artoo 
riding on the back of the fighter turns his head back and forth with 
some anxiety

INT  LUKES XWING  COCKPIT

Luke watches Artoos words as they are translated and screened on the 
computer scope

				LUKE
			into comlink
		Yes thats it  Dagobah

Artoo beeps a hopeful inquiry

				LUKE
			into comlink
		No Im not going to change my 
		mind about this
			getting a little nervous
		Im not picking up any cities or
		technology  Massive lifeform 
		readings though  Theres something
		alive down there

Artoo beeps this time a slightly worried question

				LUKE
			into comlink
		Yes Im sure its perfectly safe 
		for droids

EXT SPACE  DAGOBAH   LUKES XWING

The Xwing continues its flight through the twilight above the cloud
covered planet

INT  LUKES XWING  COCKPIT

Luke sees the cloud race by as he takes his craft closer to the planet  
He must operate his controls carefully since the cloud cover has 
completely obscured his vision  An alarm buzzes in the background 
Artoo beeps and whistles frantically

				LUKE
			into comlink
		I know I know  All the scopes are 
		dead  I cant see a thing  Just 
		hang on Im going to start the 
		landing cycle

The blast of the retrorockets is deafening drowning out Artoos 
electronic squeals  Suddenly there is a cracking sound as if limbs 
were being broken off trees and then a tremendous jolt as the 
spacecraft stops  Luke pulls a switch and his canopy pops open

EXT DAGOBAH  DUSK

The mistshrouded Xwing fighter is almost invisible in the thick fog  
Luke climbs out onto the long nose of the spacecraft as Artoo pops out 
of his cubbyhole on the back  The young warrior surveys the fog which 
is barely pierced by the ships landing lights  About all he can make 
out are some giant twisted trees nearby  Artoo whistles anxiously

				LUKE
		No Artoo you stay put  Ill 
		have a look around

Artoo lets out a short beep  As Luke moves along the nose Artoo loses 
his balance and disappears with a splash into the boggy lake

				LUKE
		Artoo

Luke kneels and leans over the plane looking for Artoo but the water 
is still and reveals no sign of the little droid

				LUKE
		Artoo  Where are you

A small periscope breaks the surface of the water and a gurgly beep is 
heard  The periscope starts to move to shore  Relieved Luke starts 
running along the nose of the fighter to its tip

				LUKE
		Artoo  You be more careful

The outline of the shore is now more than ten feet away

Luke jumps off the plane into the water scrambles up to the shore and 
turns to look for Artoo  The periscope still steadily moves toward 
shore

				LUKE
		Artoo  that way

Suddenly through the thick fog layer a dark shape appears moving 
toward the little droid  The dark sinuous bog beast dives beneath the 
swampy water making a loud clunk against Artoos metal hull  The 
droid disappears from sight uttering a pathetic electronic scream

Holding his ignited lightsaber before him Luke wades a few feet into 
the murky pool looking for any sign of his little friend

				LUKE
		Artoo

The black surface is still as death itself until a few bubbles begin 
to appear  Then phheewaat The runtsize robot is spit out of the 
water makes a graceful arc and comes crashing down into a patch of 
soft gray moss

				LUKE
		Oh no  Are you all right  Come 
		on  Youre lucky you dont taste 
		very good  Anything broken

Luke helps Artoo to his feet and begins wiping the mud and roots from 
his round metal body  Artoo responds with feeble soggy beeps

				LUKE
		If youre saying coming here was 
		a bad idea Im beginning to agree 
		with you  Oh Artoo what are we 
		doing here  Its like something 
		out of a dream or I dont know  
		Maybe Im just going crazy

As Luke glances around at the spooky swamp jungle that surrounds him 
Artoo ejects a stream of muddy water from one of his cranial ports

EXT VADERS STAR DESTROYER  VADERS CHAMBER

Admiral Piett hesitates in the entryway to Vaders private cubicle

After a moment he steps into the room and pauses at the surprising 
sight before him

Darth Vader his back turned is silhouetted in the gloom on the far 
side of the chamber  A black insectlike droid attends him  Among the 
various apparatuses surrounding them a respirator tube now retracts 
from Vaders uncovered head  The head is bald with a mass of ugly scar 
tissue covering it  The black droid then lowers the mask and helmet 
onto Vaders head  When it is in place the Dark Lord turns to face 
Piett

				VADER
		Yes Admiral

				PIETT
Our ships have sighted the 
Millennium Falcon lord  But 
it has entered an asteroid field 
and we cannot risk

				VADER
			interrupting
		Asteroids do not concern me 
		Admiral  I want that ship and 
		not excuses

				PIETT
		Yes lord

EXT ASTEROID CAVE  MILLENNIUM FALCON

The pirate starship rests in a dark dripping asteroid cave  It is so 
dark that the caves exact dimensions are impossible to determine

INT MILLENNIUM FALCON  COCKPIT

Han and Chewie busily shut down the engine and all electronic systems  
Threepio and Leia watch worriedly

				HAN
		Im going to shut down everything 
		but the emergency power systems  

				THREEPIO
		Sir Im almost afraid to ask 
		but does that include shutting 
		me down too

Chewie barks yes  But Han thinks otherwise

				HAN
		No I need you to talk to the 
		Falcon find out whats wrong with 
		the hyperdrive

Suddenly the ship lurches causing all the loose items in the cockpit 
to go flying  Chewie howls

				THREEPIO
		Sir its quite possible this 
		asteroid is not entirely stable

				HAN
		Not entirely stable  Im glad youre 
		here to tell us these things  Chewie 
		take the professor in the back and 
		plug him into the hyperdrive

				THREEPIO
		Oh  Sometimes I just dont 
		understand human behavior  After 
		all Im only trying to do my job 
		in the most

The sliding door closes behind the indignant Threepio as Chewie and he 
move back to the hold  Suddenly the ship lurches again throwing Leia 
across the cabin into Hans arms  Then abruptly the motion stops as 
suddenly as it started  With some surprise Han and Leia realize they 
are in each others arms

				LEIA
		Let go

				HAN
		Sshh

				LEIA
		Let go please

Leia flushes averting her eyes  Shes not exactly fighting to get 
free  But of course Han blows it

				HAN
		Dont get excited

The anger rises in Leia

				LEIA
		Captain being held by you isnt 
		quite enough to get me excited

				HAN
		Sorry sweetheart  We havent 
		got time for anything else

Han grins quickly wickedly at Leia as he turns and exits through the 
door  Leias confused emotions show clearly on her lovely face

EXT DAGOBAH  BOG CLEARING  DUSK

The mist has dispersed a bit but it is still a very gloomylooking 
swamp

Luke pulls an equipment box from the shore to the clearing  He ignites 
a little fusion furnace and warms his hands before it  Taking a power 
cable he plugs it into Artoos noselike socket

				LUKE
		Ready for some power  Okay  
		Lets see now  Put that in 
		there  There you go

The droid whistles his appreciation  Luke then opens a container of 
processed food and sits before the thermal heater

				LUKE
			sighs
		Now all I have to do is find this 
		Yoda if he even exists

Nervously he looks around at the foreboding jungle

				LUKE
		Still theres something familiar 
		about this place  I feel like 
		I dont know

				STRANGE VOICE
		Feel like what

Luke jumps out of his skin  Artoo screeches in terror  The young 
warrior grabs for his lightsaber as he spins around looking for the 
speaker  Mysteriously standing right in front of Luke is a strange 
bluish creature not more than two feet tall  The wizened little thing 
is dressed in rags  It motions toward Lukes sword

				LUKE
			looking at the 
			 creature
		Like were being watched

				CREATURE
		Away with your weapon  I mean 
		you no harm

After some hesitation Luke puts away his weapon although he really 
doesnt understand why  Artoo watches with interest

				CREATURE
		I am wondering why are you here

				LUKE
		Im looking for someone

				CREATURE
		Looking  Found someone you have 
		I would say hmmm

The little creature laughs

				LUKE
			Trying to keep from 
			 smiling
		Right

				CREATURE
		Help you I can  Yes mmmm

				LUKE
		I dont think so  Im looking 
		for a great warrior

				CREATURE
		Ahhh  A great warrior
			laughs and shakes 
			 his head
		Wars not make one great

With the aid of a walking stick the tiny stranger moves over to one of 
the cases of supplies  He begins to rummage around

Artoo moves to the edge of the case  standing almost eye level to the 
creature who is carelessly handling the supplies  and squeaks his 
disapproval

Their tiny visitor pick up the container of food Luke was eating from 
and takes a bite

				LUKE
		Put that down  Hey  Thats my 
		dinner

The creature spits out the bite he has taken  He makes a face

				CREATURE
		How you get so big eating food 
		of this kind

He flips the container in Lukes direction and reaches into one of 
Lukes supply cases

				LUKE
		Listen friend we didnt mean to 
		land in that puddle and if we 
		could get our ship out we would 
		but we cant so why dont you just

				CREATURE
			teasing
		Aww cannot get your ship out

The creature spots something of interest in Lukes case  Luke loses 
patience and grabs the case away  The creature retains his prize  a 
tiny power lamp  and examines it with delight

				LUKE
		Hey you could have broken this
		Dont do that  Ohhh youre 
		making a mess  Hey give me that

				CREATURE
			retreating with 
			 the lamp
		Mine  Or I will help you not

Clutching its treasure the creature backs away from Luke drawing 
closer to Artoo  As Luke and the creature argue one of Artoos little 
arms slowly moves out toward the power lamp completely unnoticed by 
the creature

				LUKE
		I dont want your help  I want 
		my lamp back  Ill need it to 
		get out of this slimy mudhole

				CREATURE
		Mudhole  Slimy  My home this is

Artoo grabs hold of the lamp and the two little figures are immediately 
engaged in a tugofwar over it

Artoo beeps a few angry Give me thats

				CREATURE
		Ah ah ah

				LUKE
		Oh Artoo let him have it

				CREATURE
		Mine  Mine

				LUKE
		Artoo

				CREATURE
		Mine

The creature lets go with one hand and pokes Artoo lightly with one 
finger  Artoo reacts with a startled squeal and lets go

				CREATURE
		Mine

				LUKE
			fed up
		Now will you move along little 
		fella  Were got a lot of work 
		to do

				CREATURE
		No  No no  Stay and help you 
		I will
			laughs
		Find your friend hmm

				LUKE
		Im not looking for a friend 
		Im looking for a Jedi Master

				CREATURE
		Oohhh  Jedi Master  Yoda  You 
		seek Yoda

				LUKE
		You know him

				CREATURE
		Mmm  Take you to him I will
			laughs
		Yes yes  But now we must eat
		Come  Good food  Come

With that the creature scurries out of the clearing laughing merrily  
Luke stares after him  All he sees is the faint light from the small 
power lamp moving through the fog  Luke makes his decision and starts 
after the creature

				CREATURE
			in the distance
		Come come

Artoo very upset whistles a blue streak of protest

				LUKE
		Stay here and watch after the 
		camp Artoo

Artoo beeps even more frantically  But as Luke disappears from view 
the worried little droid grows quieter and utters a soft electronic 
sigh

INT MILLENNIUM FALCON  MAIN HOLD AREA

Threepio whistles and beeps a strange dialect into the control panel in 
front of him  The control panel whistles back a few mystifying beeps

				THREEPIO
		Oh where is Artoo when I need 
		him

Han enters the hold area and kneels on the floor near the control box

				THREEPIO
		Sir I dont know where your ship 
		learned to communicate but it 
		has the most peculiar dialect  I 
		believe sir it says that the 
		power coupling on the negative 
		axis has been polarized  Im 
		afraid youll have to replace it

				HAN
		Well of course Ill have to replace 
		it

He hands a wire coil up to Chewie who is working near the ceiling

				HAN
		Here  And Chewie

Chewie brings his head back through the trap door in the ceiling and 
whines  Han glances back at Threepio then speaks quietly to Chewie so 
only he can hear

				HAN
			continuing
		 I think wed better replace 
		the negative power coupling

Leia finishes welding the valves she has been working on and attempts 
to reengage the system by pulling a lever attached to the valve  It 
doesnt budge  Han notices her struggle and moves to help her  She 
rebuffs him

				HAN
		Hey Your Worship Im only 
		trying to help

				LEIA
			still struggling
		Would you please stop calling me 
		that

Han hears a new tone in her voice  He watches her pull on the lever

				HAN
		Sure Leia

				LEIA
		Oh you make it so difficult 
		sometimes

				HAN
		I do I really do  You could be 
		a little nicer though
			he watches her 
			 reaction
		Come on admit it  Sometimes you 
		think Im all right

She lets go of the lever and rubs her sore hand

				LEIA
		Occasionally
			a little smile 
			 haltingly
		 when you arent acting like 
		a scoundrel

				HAN
			laughs
		Scoundrel  Scoundrel  I like 
		the sound of that

With that Han takes her hand and starts to massage it

				LEIA
		Stop that

				HAN
		Stop what

Leia is flushes confused

				LEIA
		Stop that  My hands are dirty

				HAN
		My hands are dirty too  What 
		are you afraid of

				LEIA
			looking right 
			 into his eyes
		Afraid

Han looks at her with a piercing look  Hes never looked more 
handsome more dashing more confident  He reaches out slowly and 
takes Leias hand again from where it is resting on a console  He 
draws it toward him

				HAN
		Youre trembling

				LEIA
		Im not trembling

Then with an irresistible combination of physical strength and 
emotional power the space pirate begins to draw Leia toward him 
very slowly

				HAN
		You like me because Im a scoundrel
		There arent enough scoundrels in 
		your life

Leia is now very close to Han and as she speaks her voice becomes an 
excited whisper a tone completely in opposition to her words

				LEIA
		I happen to like nice men

				HAN
		Im a nice man

				LEIA
		No youre not  Youre

He kisses her now with slow hot lips  He takes his time as though 
he had forever bending her body backward  She has never been kissed 
like this before and it almost makes her faint  When he stops she 
regains her breath and tries to work up some indignation but finds it 
hard to talk

Suddenly Threepio appears in the doorway speaking excitedly

				THREEPIO
		Sir sir  Ive isolated the 
		reverse power flux coupling

Han turns slowly icily from their embrace

				HAN
		Thank you  Thank you very much

				THREEPIO
		Oh youre perfectly welcome sir

The moment spoiled Han marches out after Threepio

Asteroids collide creating a fireworks display outside the bridge 
window  Darth Vader stands staring out the window above the control 
deck  Then slowly turns toward the bridge  Before him are the 
hologram images of twenty battleship commanders  One of these images 
the commander of a ship that has just exploded is fading away quickly  
Another image in the center and a little apart from the others is 
faded and continually disrupted by static  It is the image of Captain 
Needa commander of the Star Destroyer most hotly on the tail of the

INT VADERS STAR DESTROYER  VADERS CHAMBER

The Dark Lord Darth Vader is alone in his chamber  A strange sound 
enters the room and a light begins to play across Vaders black figure  
He looks up and bows quickly

A twelvefoot hologram of the Galactic Emperor materializes before 
Vader  The Emperors dark robes and monks hood are reminiscent of the 
cloak worn by Ben Kenobi  His voice is even deeper and more 
frightening than Vaders

EXT DAGOBAH  CREATURES HOUSE  NIGHT

A heavy downpour of rain pounds through the gnarled trees  A strange 
baroque mud house sits on a mosscovered knoll on the edge of a small 
lagoon  The small gnomish structure radiates a warm glow from its 
thick glass windows  As rain tapdances a merry tune on Artoos head 
the stubby little droid rises up on his tiptoes to peek into one of 
the glowing portals

INT CREATURES HOUSE

Artoo peeking in the window sees the inside of the house  a very 
plain but cozy dwelling  Everything is in the same small scale as the 
creature  The only thing out of place in the miniature room is Luke 
whose height makes the fourfoot ceiling seem even lower  He sits 
crosslegged on the floor of the living room

The creature is in an adjoining area  his little kitchen  cooking up 
an incredible meal  The stove is a steaming hodgepodge of pots and 
pans  The wizened little host scurries about chopping this shredding 
that and showering everything with exotic herbs and spices  He rushes 
back and forth putting platters on the table in front of Luke who 
watches the creature impatiently

				LUKE
		Look Im sure its delicious  
		I just dont understand why we 
		cant see Yoda now

				CREATURE
		Patience  For the Jedi it is 
		time to eat as well  Eat eat  
		Hot  Good food hm Good hmm

Moving with some difficulty in the cramped quarters Luke sits down 
near the fire and serves himself from the pot  Tasting the unfamiliar 
concoction he is pleasantly surprised

				LUKE
		How far away is Yoda  Will it 
		take us long to get there

				CREATURE
		Not far  Yoda not far  Patience
		Soon you will be with him
			tasting food from 
			 the pot
		Rootleaf I cook  Why wish you 
		become Jedi  Hm

				LUKE
		Mostly because of my father I 
		guess

				CREATURE
		Ah your father  Powerful Jedi 
		was he powerful Jedi mmm

				LUKE
			a little angry
		Oh come on  How could you know 
		my father  You dont even know 
		who I am
			fed up
		Oh I dont know what Im doing 
		here  Were wasting our time

The creature turns away from Luke and speaks to a third party

				CREATURE
			irritated
		I cannot teach him  The boy has 
		no patience

Lukes head spins in the direction the creature faces  But there is no 
one there  The boy is bewildered but it gradually dawns on him that 
the little creature is Yoda the Jedi Master and that he is speaking 
with Ben

				BENS VOICE
		He will learn patience

				YODA
		Hmmm  Much anger in him like his father

				BENS VOICE
		Was I any different when you 
		taught me

				YODA
		Hah  He is not ready

				LUKE
		Yoda  I am ready  I Ben  I 
		can be a Jedi  Ben tell him Im 
		ready

Trying to see Ben Luke starts to get up but hits his head on the low 
ceiling

				YODA
		Ready are you  What know you 
		of ready  For eight hundred years 
		have I trained Jedi  My own counsel 
		will I keep on who is to be trained
		A Jedi must have the deepest 
		commitment the most serious mind
			to the invisible 
			 Ben indicating Luke
		This one a long time have I watched
		All his life has he looked away
		to the future to the horizon
		Never his mind on where he was
		Hmm  What he was doing  Hmph  
		Adventure  Heh  Excitement  Heh  
		A Jedi craves not these things
			turning to Luke
		You are reckless

Luke looks down  He knows it is true

				BENS VOICE
		So was I if youll remember

				YODA
		He is too old  Yes too old to 
		begin the training

Luke thinks he detects a subtle softening in Yodas voice

				LUKE
		But Ive learned so much

Yoda turns his piercing gaze on Luke as though the Jedi Masters huge 
eyes could somehow determine how much the boy had learned  After a 
long moment the little Jedi turns toward where he alone sees Ben

				YODA
			sighs
		Will he finished what he begins

				LUKE
		I wont fail you  Im not afraid

				YODA
			turns slowly toward 
			 him
		Oh you will be  You will be

INT ASTEROID CAVE  MILLENNIUM FALCON  COCKPIT

The cockpit is quiet and lit only by the indicator lights on the 
control panel  Princess Leia sits in the pilots seat

She runs her hand across the control panel as she thinks of Han and the 
confusion he has created within her  Suddenly something outside the 
cockpit window catches her eye  The reflection of the panel lights 
obscures her vision until a soft suctionlike cup attaches itself to the 
windscreen  Leia
moves closer to see what it might be  Large yellow eyes flash open 
and stare back at her  Startled she jumps back into her seat her 
heart pounding  There is a scurry of feet and a loud screech and in 
an instant the eyes are gone  The young princess catches her breath 
jumps out of her chair and races from the cockpit

INT ASTEROID CAVE  MILLENNIUM FALCON  HOLD AREA

The lights go bright for a second then out again  Threepio and 
Chewbacca watch as Han finishes with some wires

				THREEPIO
		Sir if I may venture an opinion

Leia rushes into the cabin just as Han drops the final floor panel into 
place

				LEIA
			out of breath
		Theres something out there

		Where

				LEIA
		Outside in the cave

As she speaks there comes a sharp banging on the hull  Chewie looks 
up and barks anxiously

He and Chewie grab their breath masks off a rack and hurry out  Leia 
follows

		I think it might be better if I 
		stay here and guard the ship
			hears another 
			 mysterious noise
		Oh no

EXT ASTEROID CAVE  MILLENNIUM FALCON

It is very dark inside the huge asteroid cave too dark to see what is 
attacking the ship

Leia stamps her foot on the floor of the cave

				LEIA
		This ground sure feels strange
		It doesnt feel like rock at all

Han kneels and studies the ground then attempts to study the outline 
of the cave

				HAN
		Theres an awful lot of moisture 
		in here

				LEIA
		I dont know  I have a bad feeling 
		about this

				HAN
		Yeah

Chewie barks through his face mask and points toward the ships 
cockpit  A fivefootlong shape can be seen moving across the top of 
the Falcon  The leathery creature lets out a screech as Han blasts it 
with a laser bolt

				HAN
			to Leia
		Watch out

The black shape tumbles off the spaceship and onto the ground in front 
of the princess  Han bends down to investigate the dead creature

				HAN
		Yeah thats what I thought
		Mynock  Chewie check the rest 
		of the ship make sure there 
		arent any more attached  Theyre 
		chewing on the power cables

				LEIA
		Mynocks

				HAN
		Go on inside  Well clean them 
		off if there are any more

Just then a swarm of the ugly creatures swoops through the air  Leia 
puts her arms over her head to protect herself as she runs toward the 
ship  Chewie shoos another Mynock away with his blaster  Several of 
the batlike creatures flap their wings loudly against the cockpit 
window of the Falcon  Inside Threepio shudders at their presence

				THREEPIO
		Ohhh  Go away  Go away  Beastly 
		little thing  Shoo  Shoo

Han looks around the strange dripping cave

				HAN
		Wait a minute

He unholsters his blaster and fires at the far side of the huge cave  
The cavern begins to shake and the ground starts to buckle

Chewie barks and moves for the ship followed closely by Leia and Han  
The large wings of the Mynocks flap past them as they protect their 
faces and run up the platform

INT ASTEROID CAVE  MILLENNIUM FALCON  ENTRY AREA

As soon as Han and Leia are on board Chewie closes the main hatch  
The ship continues to shake and heave

				HAN
		All right Chewie lets get 
		out of here

The Wookiee heads for the cockpit as Han followed by Threepio rushes 
to the hold area and checks the scopes on the control panel  Leia 
hurries after

				LEIA
		The Empire is still out there
		I dont think its wise to

Han rushes past her and heads for the cockpit

				HAN
			interrupting
		No time to discuss this in
		committee

And with that he is gone  The main engines of the Falcon begin to 
whine  Leia races after him bouncing around in the shaking ship

				LEIA
			angry
		I am not a committee

INT ASTEROID CAVE  MILLENNIUM FALCON  COCKPIT

Han is already in the pilots seat pulling back on the throttle  The 
cavequake has greatly diminished

				LEIA
		You cant make the jump to light
		speed in this asteroid field

				HAN
		Sit down sweetheart  Were 
		taking off

As the ship begins to move forward Chewie barks  He notices something 
out the window ahead  Threepio sees it too

				THREEPIO
		Look

				HAN
		I see it I see it

Suddenly a row of jagged white stalagmites and stalactites can be seen 
surrounding the entrance  And as the Falcon moves forward the 
entrance to the cave grows ever smaller  Han pulls hard on the 
throttle sending his ship surging forward

				THREEPIO
		Were doomed

				LEIA
		The cave is collapsing

				HAN
		This is no cave

				LEIA
		What

Leias mouth drops open   She sees that the rocks of the cave entrance 
are not rocks at all but giant teeth quickly closing around the tiny 
ship  Chewie howls

INT SPACE SLUG MOUTH

The Millennium Falcon zooming through the monsters mouth rolls on 
its side and barely makes it between two of the gigantic white teeth 
before the huge jaws slams closed

EXT CAVE ENTRANCE  GIANT ASTEROID

The enormous space slug moves its head out of the cave as the Falcon 
flies out of its mouth  The monster tilts its head watching the 
starship fly away

EXT MILLENNIUM FALCON  GIANT ASTEROID

The Falcon races out of the asteroid crater and into the deadly rain of 
the asteroid storm

EXT DAGOBAH  DAY

With Yoda strapped to his back Luke climbs up one of the many thick 
vines that grow in the swamp  Panting heavily he continues his course 
 climbing flipping through the air jumping over roots and racing in 
and out of the heavy ground fog

				YODA
		Run  Yes  A Jedis strength 
		flows from the Force  But beware 
		of the dark side  Anger fear 
		aggression  The dark side of 
		the Force are they
		Easily they flow quick to join 
		you in a fight  If once you 
		start down the dark path forever 
		will it dominate your destiny 
		consume you it will as it did 
		ObiWans apprentice

				LUKE
		Vader  Is the dark side stronger

				YODA
		No no no  Quicker easier 
		more seductive

				LUKE
		But how am I to know the good side 
		from the bad

				YODA
		You will know  When you are calm 
		at peace  Passive  A Jedi uses 
		the Force for knowledge and 
		defense never for attack

				LUKE
		But tell me why I cant

				YODA
			interrupting
		No no there is no why  Nothing 
		more will I teach you today
		Clear your mind of questions  
		Mmm  Mmmmmmmm

Artoo beeps in the distance as Luke lets Yoda down to the ground  
Breathing heavily he takes his shirt from a nearby tree branch and 
pulls it on

He turns to see a huge dead black tree its base surrounded by a few 
feet of water  Giant twisted roots form a dark and sinister cave on 
one side  Luke stares at the tree trembling

				LUKE
		Theres something not right here

Yoda sits on a large root poking his Gimer Stick into the dirt

				LUKE
		I feel cold death

				YODA
		That place is strong with the 
		dark side of the Force  A domain 
		of evil it is  In you must go

				LUKE
		Whats in there

				YODA
		Only what you take with you

Luke looks warily between the tree and Yoda  He starts to strap on his 
weapon belt

				YODA
		Your weapons you will not 
		need them

Luke gives the tree a long look than shakes his head no  Yoda 
shrugs  Luke reaches up to brush aside some hanging vines and enters 
the tree

INT DAGOBAH  TREE CAVE

Luke moves into the almost total darkness of the wet and slimy cave  
The youth can barely make out the edge of the passage  Holding his lit 
saber before him he sees a lizard crawling up the side of the cave and 
a snake wrapped around the branches of a tree  Luke draws a deep 
breath then pushes deeper into the cave

The space widens around him but he feels that rather than sees it  
His sword casts the only light as he peers into the darkness  It is 
very quiet here

Then a loud HISS Darth Vader appears across the blackness 
illuminated by his own justignited laser sword  Immediately he 
charges Luke saber held high  He is upon the youth in seconds but 
Luke sidesteps perfectly and slashes at Vader with his sword

Vader is decapitated  His helmetencased head flies from his shoulders 
as his body disappears into the darkness  The metallic banging of the 
helmet fills the cave as Vaders head spins and bounces smashes on the 
floor and finally stops For an instant it rests on the floor then it 
cracks vertically  The black helmet and breath mask fall away to 
reveal Lukes head

Across the space the standing Luke gasps at the sight wideeyed in 
terror

The decapitated head fades away as in a vision

EXT DAGOBAH  CAVE  DUSK

Meanwhile Yoda sits on the root calmly leaning on his Gimer Stick

EXT SPACE  VADERS STAR DESTROYER

Vaders Imperial Star Destroyer moves through space guarded by its 
convoy of TIE fighters

INT VADERS STAR DESTROYER  BRIDGE  CONTROL DECK

Vader stands in the back control area of his ships bridge with a 
motley group of men and creatures  Admiral Piett and two controllers 
stand at the front of the bridge and watch the group with scorn

				PIETT
		Bounty hunters  We dont need 
		that scum

				FIRST CONTROLLER
		Yes sir

				PIETT
		Those Rebels wont escape us

A second controller interrupts

				SECOND CONTROLLER
		Sir we have a priority signal 
		from the Star Destroyer Avenger

				PIETT
		Right

The group standing before Vader is a bizarre array of galactic fortune 
hunters  There is Bossk a slimy tentacled monster with two huge 
bloodshot eyes in a soft baggy face Zuckuss and Dengar two battle
scarred mangy human types IG a battered tarnished chrome war 
droid and Boba Fett a man in a weaponcovered armored space suit

				VADER
		 there will be a substantial 
		reward for the one who finds the 
		Millennium Falcon  You are free 
		to use any methods necessary but 
		I want them alive  No disintegrations

				BOBA FETT
		As you wish

At that moment Admiral Piett approaches Vader in a rush of excitement

				PIETT
		Lord Vader  My lord we have 
		them

EXT IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER AVENGER  ASTEROID BELT

The Millennium Falcon speeds through deep space closely followed by a 
firing Imperial Star Destroyer  A large asteroid about the same size 
as the Falcon tumbles rapidly toward the starship  The tiny Falcon 
banks to avoid the giant asteroid as smaller rocks pelt its surface  
Then the small craft roars under the asteroid which explodes harmlessly 
on the hull of the vast Star Destroyer

INT MILLENNIUM FALCON  COCKPIT

The ship shudders as flak explodes near the cockpit window  Threepio 
checks a tracking scope an the side control panel while Leia watches 
tensely out the window

				THREEPIO
		Oh thank goodness were coming 
		out of the asteroid field

Chewie barks excitedly as the rain of asteroids begins to subside  A 
bolt from the Star Destroyer sets up a fiery explosion on the back side 
of the Falcon causing it to lurch to one side

EXT MILLENNIUM FALCON  STAR DESTROYER AVENGER  ASTEROID FIELD

The Falcon is hit hard by another bolt from the Star Destroyer which 
creates a huge explosion near the cockpit of the smaller ship  The 
Falcon tilts steeply then rights itself

INT MILLENNIUM FALCON  COCKPIT

Han corrects the angle of his ship

				HAN
		Lets get out of here  Ready for 
		lightspeed  One two three

Han pulls back on the hyperspace throttle and  nothing happens  Flak 
bursts continue to rock the ship

				HAN
			frantic
		Its not fair

Chewie is very angry and starts to growl and bark at his friend and 
captain  Again Han desperately pulls back on the throttle

				HAN
		The transfer circuits are working
		Its not my fault

Chewie puts his head in his hands whining

				LEIA
			almost expecting 
			 it
		No lightspeed

				HAN
		Its not my fault

				THREEPIO
		Sir we just lost the main rear 
		deflector shield  One more direct 
		hit on the back quarter and were 
		done for

Han pauses for a moment makes a decision and pulls back on a lever

				HAN
		Turn her around

Chewie barks in puzzlement

				HAN
		I said turn her around  Im 
		going to put all power in the 
		front shield

				LEIA
		Youre going to attack them

				THREEPIO
		Sir the odds of surviving a

		Shut up

EXT SPACE  MILLENNIUM FALCON  ASTEROID FIELD

The Falcon banks makes a steep twisting turn  In the next moment it 
is racing toward the Star Destroyer looking very small against the 
massive surface of the Imperial ship  As it moves across the surface 
of the Star Destroyer the Falcon bobs and weaves to avoid the numerous 
flak bursts

INT STAR DESTROYER AVENGER  BRIDGE

The tiny Falcon heads directly for the Avengers bridge  The Imperials 
stationed there are stunned to see the small spaceship racing low 
across the hull headed directly at the huge windows of the bridge 
area  Alarms go off everywhere  The Destroyers commander Captain 
Needa can scarcely believe his eyes

				NEEDA
		Theyre moving to attack 
		position  Shields up

Needa and his men duck as the Falcon nears the bridge window  At the 
last minute the Falcon veers off and out of sight  All is quiet

EXT DAGOBAH  BOG  DAY

Lukes face is upsidedown and showing enormous strain  He stands on 
his hands with Yoda perched on his feet  Opposite Luke and Yoda are 
two rocks the size of bowling balls  Luke stares at the rocks and 
concentrates  One of the rocks lifts from the ground and floats up to 
rest on the other

				YODA
		Use the Force  Yes

Yoda taps Lukes leg  Quickly Luke lifts one hand from the ground  
His body wavers but he maintains his balance  Artoo standing nearby 
is whistling and beeping frantically

				YODA
		Now the stone  Feel it

Luke concentrates on trying to lift the top rock  It rises a few feet 
shaking under the strain  But distracted by Artoos frantic beeping 
Luke loses his balance and finally collapses  Yoda jumps clear

				YODA
		Concentrate

Annoyed at the disturbance Luke looks over at Artoo who is rocking 
urgently back and forth in front of him

Artoo waddles closer to Luke chirping wildly then scoots over the 
edge of the swamp  Catching on Luke rushes to the waters edge  The 
Xwing fighter has sunk and only the tip of its nose shows above the 
lakes surface

				LUKE
		Oh no  Well never get it out 
		now

Yoda stamps his foot in irritation

				YODA
		So certain are you  Always with 
		you it cannot be done  Hear you
		nothing that I say

Luke looks uncertainly out at the ship

				LUKE
		Master moving stones around is 
		one thing  This is totally 
		different

				YODA
		No  No different  Only different 
		in your mind  You must unlearn 
		what you have learned

				LUKE
			focusing quietly
		All right Ill give it a try

				YODA
		No  Try not  Do  Or do not  
		There is no try

Luke closes his eyes and concentrates on thinking the ship out

Slowly the Xwings nose begins to rise above the water  It hovers 
for a moment and then slides back disappearing once again

				LUKE
			panting heavily
		I cant  Its too big

				YODA
		Size matters not  Look at me  
		Judge me by my size do you  
		Hm  Mmmm

Luke shakes his head

				YODA
		And well you should not  For my 
		ally in the Force  And a powerful 
		ally it is  Life creates it makes 
		it grow  Its energy surrounds us 
		and binds us  Luminous beings 
		are we
			Yoda pinches 
			 Lukes shoulder
		 not this crude matter
			a sweeping gesture
		You must feel the Force around you
			gesturing
		Here between you me the 
		tree the rock everywhere  
		Yes even between this land and 
		that ship

				LUKE
			discouraged
		You want the impossible

Quietly Yoda turns toward the Xwing fighter  With his eyes closed and 
his head bowed he raises his arm and points at the ship

Soon the fighter rises above the water and moves forward as Artoo 
beeps in terror and scoots away

The entire Xwing moves majestically surely toward the shore  Yoda 
stands on a tree root and guides the fighter carefully down toward the 
beach

Luke stares in astonishment as the fighter settles down onto the shore  
He walks toward Yoda

				LUKE
		I dont I dont believe it

				YODA
		That is why you fail

Luke shakes his head bewildered

sits on the ground below the young warrior  On the other side of the

watches humming to himself when suddenly he too rises into the air  
His little legs kick desperately and his head turns frantically 
looking for help

A laser bolt to Threepios chest sends him flying in twenty directions  
Smoldering mechanical arms and legs bounce off the walls as the door 
whooshes closed behind him

INT CLOUD CITY  CORRIDOR

Lando Han and Leia continue down the corridor unaware of Threepios 
dreadful accident  Chewbacca glances around sniffs the air but 
shrugs his shoulders and follows the group

EXT DAGOBAH  BOG  DUSK

In the bright lights of the fighter Luke loads a heavy case into the 
belly of the ship  Artoo sits on top of the Xwing settling down into 
his cubbyhole  Yoda stands nearby on a log

				YODA
		Luke  You must complete the 
		training

				LUKE
		I cant keep the vision out of my 
		head  Theyre my friends  Ive 
		got to help them

				YODA
		You must not go

				LUKE
		But Han and Leia will die if I 
		dont

				BENS VOICE
		You dont know that

Luke looks toward the voice in amazement  Ben has materialized as a 
real slightly shimmering image near Yoda  The power of his presence 
stops Luke

				BEN
		Even Yoda cannot see their fate

				LUKE
		But I can help them  I feel 
		the Force

				BEN
		But you cannot control it  This 
		is a dangerous time for you 
		when you will be tempted by the 
		dark side of the Force

				YODA
		Yes yes  To ObiWan you listen
		The cave  Remember your failure 
		at the cave

				LUKE
		But Ive learned so much since 
		then  Master Yoda I promise to 
		return and finish what Ive begun 
		You have my word

				BEN
		It is you and your abilities the 
		Emperor wants  that is why your 
		friends are made to suffer

				LUKE
		And that is why I have to go

				BEN
		Luke I dont want to lose you to 
		the Emperor the way I lost Vader

				LUKE
		You wont

				YODA
		Stopped they must be  On this 
		all depends  Only a fully trained 
		Jedi Knight with the Force as his 
		ally will conquer Vader and his 
		Emperor  If you end your training 
		now if you choose the quick and 
		easy path as Vader did you will 
		become an agent of evil

				BEN
		Patience

				LUKE
		And sacrifice Han and Leia

				YODA
		If you honor what they fight for
		 yes

Luke is in great anguish  He struggles with the dilemma a battle 
raging in his mind

				BEN
		If you choose to face Vader you 
		will do it alone  I cannot 
		interfere

				LUKE
		I understand
			he moves to his 
			 Xwing
		Artoo fire up the converters

Artoo whistles a happy reply

				BEN
		Luke dont give in to hate  
		that leads to the dark side

Luke nods and climbs into his ship

				YODA
		Strong is Vader  Mind what you 
		have learned  Save you it can

				LUKE
		I will  And Ill return  I promise

Artoo closes the cockpit  Ben and Yoda stand watching as the roar of 
the engines and the wind engulf them

				YODA
			sighs
		Told you I did  Reckless is 
		he  Now matters are worse

		That boy is our last hope

INT CLOUD CITY  LIVING QUARTERS  DAY

Within the quarters assigned her on Cloud City Leia paces in 
agitation  She has changed from her coldweather pants and jacket to a 
lovely dress  Her hair is down tied back with ribbons  She moves 
from a large open window and turns to see Han entering through the 
doorway

				HAN
		The ship is almost finished
		Two or Three more things and 
		were in great shape

				LEIA
		The sooner the better  Somethings 
		wrong here  No one has seen or 
		knows anything about Threepio
		Hes been gone too long to have 
		gotten lost

Han takes Leia by the shoulders and gently kisses her forehead

				HAN
		Relax  Ill talk to Lando and 
		see what I can find out

				LEIA
		I dont trust Lando

				HAN
		Well I dont trust him either
		But he is my friend  Besides 
		well soon be gone

				LEIA
		And then youre as good as gone 
		arent you

Not speaking Han considers her words and gazes at her troubled face

INT CLOUD CITY  JUNK ROOM

The room is piled high with broken and discarded machine parts  Four 
Ugnaughts small hoglike creatures separate the junk and throw some 
pieces onto a conveyer belt which moves briskly toward a pit of molten 
metal  Pieces of Threepios golden body move down the belt  Chewie 
enters the room and spots an Ugnaught picking up and inspecting 
Threepios head  The Wookiee barks a command startling the Ugnaught 
then reaches to grab the head  But the Ugnaught tosses it away from 
him to another Ugnaught  This game of keepaway goes on until 
Threepios head falls from their grip and bounces with a clang onto the 
ground

INT CLOUD CITY  LIVING QUARTERS  DAY

The door zaps open  Chewbacca walks in carrying a packing case of 
Threepio arms and legs hanging over the edge

				LEIA
		What happened

Chewie sets the case on a table grunting and groaning an explanation

				HAN
		Where  Found him in a junk pile

				LEIA
		Oh what a mess  Chewie do you 
		think you can repair him

The giant Wookiee studies the array of robot parts  He looks at the 
princess and shrugs sadly

				HAN
		Landos got people who can fix 
		him

				LEIA
		No thanks

There is a buzz and the door slides open revealing Lando

				LANDO
		Im sorry  Am I interrupting 
		anything

				LEIA
		Not really

				LANDO
		You look absolutely beautiful
		You truly belong here with us 
		among the clouds

				LEIA
			coolly
		Thank you

				LANDO
		Will you join me for a little 
		refreshment

Han looks at Lando suspiciously but Chewie barks at the mention of 
food and licks his lips

				LANDO
		Everyones invited of course

Leia takes Landos proffered arm and the group turns to go  Lando 
spots Threepios remains

				LANDO
		Having trouble with you droid

Han and Leia exchange a quick glance

				HAN
		No  No problem  Why

Han and Leia move arminarm through the door followed by Lando and 
Chewie  The door slides closed behind them

INT CLOUD CITY  CORRIDOR  DAY

Leia walks between Han and Lando as Chewie follows a short distance 
behind  Long shafts of light pour across the corridor between tall 
purewhite columns

				LANDO
		So you see since were a small 
		operation we dont fall into 
		the uh jurisdiction of the 
		Empire

				LEIA
		So youre part of the mining 
		guild then

				LANDO
		No not actually  Our operation 
		is small enough not to be noticed 
		which is advantageous for everybody 
		since our customers are anxious 
		to avoid attracting attention to 
		themselves

The group walks into another corridor and heads for a huge doorway at 
the far end

				HAN
		Arent you afraid the Empires 
		going to find out about this 
		little operation and shut you down

				LANDO
		Thats always been a danger looming 
		like a shadow over everything weve 
		built here  But things have 
		developed that will insure security
		Ive just made a deal that will 
		keep the Empire out of here forever

INT CLOUD CITY  DINING ROOM

The mighty doors to the dining room slide open and the group enters the 
dining room  At the far end of a huge banquet table sits Darth Vader  
Standing at his side and slightly behind him is Boba Fett the bounty 
hunter

Faster than the wink of an eye Han draws his blaster and pops off a 
couple of shots directly at Vader  The Dark Lord quickly raises his 
hand deflecting the bolts into one of the side walls where they 
explode harmlessly  Just as quickly Hans weapon zips into Vaders 
hand  The evil presence calmly places the gun on the table in front of 
him

				VADER
		We would be honored if you would 
		join us

Han gives Lando a mean look

				LANDO
		I had no choice  They arrived 
right before you did  Im sorry

		No Threepios with them

Artoo whistles another worried inquiry

				LUKE
			into comlink
		Just hang on  Were almost there

INT CLOUD CITY  LARGE CELL

Chewbacca is in a Cloud City prison cell  The stark room is flooded 
with hot light  To add to Chewies misery a highpitched whistle 
screeches loudly  Chewie is going mad  He hits the wall with giant 
fists as he paces back and forth across the cell floor  The upper 
lights go off abruptly  The prisoner rubs his eyes and moves to a 
wall where he listens for a moment  Then moaning to himself he 
moves to a platform where the disassembled pieces of Threepio lie  He 
picks up the golden droids head and meditates on it for a moment 
barking a few philosophical remarks  Chewie sticks the robots head on 
its torso and starts adjusting wires and circuits

Suddenly the lights in Threepios eyes spark to life as Chewie touches 
two connectors together  Threepio immediately begins to speak but his 
voice is so slow and so low as to be nearly unintelligible

				THREEPIO
		Mmmm  Oh my  Uh I uh  Take 
		this off  I uh dont mean to 
		intrude here  I dont no no 
		no Please dont get up  No

Chewie looks at Threepio in bewilderment then scratches his furry 
head  He gets an idea and adjusts some connections whereupon Threepio 
immediately begins speaking normally

				THREEPIO
		Stormtroopers  Here  Were in 
		danger  I must tell the others
		Oh no  Ive been shot

INT CLOUD CITY  PRISON ENTRY AREA

Darth Vader strides through the room as two stormtroopers prepare an 
elaborate torture mechanism  Han is strapped to a rack which tilts 
forward onto the torture device  Vader activates the mechanism 
creating two bursts of sparks one of which strikes Hans face

The door opens and Vader leaves the torture room just as Han screams a 
sharp piercing cry of agony  Darth Vader moves to the holding 
chamber where Lando and Boba Fett await him

INT CLOUD CITY  HOLDING CHAMBER

				LANDO
		Lord Vader

				VADER
			to Fett
		You may take Captain Solo to 
		Jabba the Hut after I have 
		Skywalker

Hans screams filter through the torture room door

				BOBA FETT
		Hes no good to me dead

				VADER
		He will not be permanently damaged

				LANDO
		Lord Vader what about Leia and 
		the Wookiee

				VADER
		They must never again leave this 
		city

				LANDO
		That was never a condition of our 
		agreement nor was giving Han to 
		this bounty hunter

				VADER
		Perhaps you think youre being 
		treated unfairly

				LANDO
		No

				VADER
		Good  It would be unfortunate if 
		I had to leave a garrison here

Vader turns and sweeps into the elevator with Boba Fett  Lando walks 
swiftly down another corridor muttering to himself

				LANDO
		This deals getting worse all 
		the time

INT CLOUD CITY  LARGE CELL

Chewie now has a little more of Threepio back together  One arm is 
connected but the legs are yet to be attached  There is one small 
problem however  It seems the Wookiee has managed to put the droids 
head on backwards

				THREEPIO
		Oh yes thats very good  I like 
		that  Oh  Somethings not right 
		because now I cant see  Wait  
		Wait  Oh my  what have you done  
		Im backwards you stupid furball  
		Only an overgrown mophead like you 
		would be stupid enough

Threepio is cut off in midsentence as Chewie angrily deactivates a 
circuit and the droid shuts down  The Wookiee smells something and 
sits up  The door to the chamber slides open and a ragged Han Solo is 
shoved into the room by two stormtroopers  Barking his concern the 
huge Wookiee gives Han a big hug  Han is very pale with dark circles 
under his eyes

				HAN
		I feel terrible

Chewie helps Han to a platform and then turns as the door slides open 
revealing Leia  She too looks a little worse for wear  The troopers 
push her into the cell and the door slides closed  She moves to Han 
who is lying on the platform and kneels next to him gently stroking 
his head

				LEIA
		Why are they doing this

				HAN
		They never even asked me any 
		questions

The cell door slides open  Lando and two of his guards enter

				LEIA
		Lando

				HAN
		Get out of here Lando

				LANDO
		Shut up and listen  Vader has 
		agreed to turn Leia and Chewie 
		over to me

				HAN
		Over to you

				LANDO
		Theyll have to stay here but at 
		least theyll be safe

				LEIA
		What about Han

				LANDO
		Vaders giving him to the bounty 
		hunter

				LEIA
		Vader wants us all dead

				LANDO
		He doesnt want you at all  Hes 
		after somebody called Skywalker

				HAN
		Luke

				LANDO
		Lord Vader has set a trap for him

Leias mind is racing

				LEIA
		And were the bait

				LANDO
		Well hes on his way

Hans rage peaks

				HAN
		Perfect  You fixed us all pretty 
		good didnt you
			spits it out
		My friend

Han hauls off and punches Lando  The two friends are instantly engaged 
in a frantic closequarters fight  The guards hit Han with their rifle 
butts and he flies across the room  Chewie growls and starts for the 
guards  They point their laser weapons at the giant Wookiee but Lando 
stops them

				LANDO
		Stop  Ive done all I can  Im 
		sorry I couldnt do better but 
		I have my own problems

				HAN
		Yeah youre a real hero

Lando and the guards leave  Han wipes the blood from his chin as Leia 
and Chewie help him up

				LEIA
			dabs at his wound
		You certainly have a way with 
		people

INT CLOUD CITY  CARBONFREEZING CHAMBER

Four armorsuited stormtroopers stand at the ready in the large 
chamber which is filled with pipes and chemical tanks  In the middle 
of the room is a round pit housing a hydraulic platform  Darth Vader 
and Lando stand near the platform

				VADER
		This facility is crude but it 
		should be adequate to freeze 
		Skywalker for his journey to the 
		Emperor

An Imperial soldier appears

				IMPERIAL SOLDIER
		Lord Vader ship approaching
		Xwing class

				VADER
		Good  Monitor Skywalker and allow 
		him to land

The soldier bows and leaves the chamber

				LANDO
		Lord Vader we only use this 
		facility for carbon freezing  If 
		you put him in there it might 
		kill him

				VADER
		I do not want the Emperors prize 
		damaged  We will test it on 
		Captain Solo

Landos face registers dismay

EXT SPACE  BESPIN SYSTEM   LUKES XWING

Lukes Xwing moves through the clouds as it nears the city

INT  LUKES XWING  COCKPIT

Encountering no city guards Luke scans the display panel with concern

INT CLOUD CITY  CARBONFREEZING CHAMBER

There is a great activity on the carbonfreezing platform  Six 
Ugnaughts frantically prepare the chamber for use  A special 
coffinlike container is put in place  With Boba Fett in the lead a 
squad of six stormtroopers brings in Han Leia and Chewie  Strapped to 
Chewies back with only his head torso and one arm assembled is 
Threepio  Threepios head faces the opposite direction from Chewies 
and the droid is constantly twisting around in a vain effort to see 
what is happening  His one attached arm is animate and expressive 
intermittently pointing gesturing and covering his eyes  The 
remaining pieces of his body are randomly bundled to the Wookiees back 
so that his legs and other arm stick out at odd angles from the pack

				THREEPIO
		If only you had attached my legs 
		I wouldnt be in this ridiculous 
		position  Now remember Chewbacca 
		you have a responsibility to me 
		so dont do anything foolish

				HAN
			to Lando
		Whats going on buddy

				LANDO
		Youre being put into carbon freeze

Boba Fett moves away from the group to Darth Vader

				BOBA FETT
		What if he doesnt survive  Hes 
		worth a lot to me

				VADER
		The Empire will compensate you 
		if he dies  Put him in

Realizing what is about to happen Chewie lets out a wild howl and 
attacks the stormtroopers surrounding Han  Within seconds other 
Imperial reinforcements join the scuffle clubbing the giant Wookiee 
with their laser weapons

From the instant of Chewies first move Threepio begins to scream in 
panic while he tries to protect himself with his one arm

				THREEPIO
		Oh no  No no no  Stop 
		Chewbacca stop

The stormtroopers are about to bash Chewie in the face

				HAN
		Stop Chewie stop  Do you hear 
		me  Stop

				THREEPIO
		Yes stop please  Im not ready 
		to die

Han breaks away from his captors  Vader nods to the guards to let him 
go and the pirate breaks up the fight

				HAN
		Chewie  Chewie this wont help 
		me  Hey

Han gives the Wookiee a stern look

				HAN
		Save your strength  Therell be 
		another time  The princess  you 
		have to take care of her  You 
		hear me

Han winks at the Wookiee who wails a doleful farewell

In a flash the guards have slipped binders on Chewbacca who is too 
distraught to protest  Han turns to Princess Leia  They look 
sorrowfully at one another then Han moves toward her and gives her a 
final passionate kiss

				LEIA
		I love you

				HAN
		I know

Tears roll down Leias face as she watches the dashing pirate walk to 
the hydraulic platform  Han looks one final time at his friends  and 
then suddenly the platform drops  Chewie howls  Leia turns away in 
agony

Lando winces in sorrow it makes a lifechanging impression on him

Instantly fiery liquid begins to pour down in a shower of sparks and 
fluid as great as any steel furnace  Holding Leia Chewie halfturns 
away from the sight giving Threepio a view of the procedure

				THREEPIO
		What whats going on  Turn 
		round Chewbacca I cant see  
		Oh theyve encased him in 
		carbonite  He should be quite 
		wellprotected  if he survives 
		the freezing process that is

Chewie is in no mood for technical discussion he gives the droid an 
angry glance and bark

A huge mechanical tong lifts the steaming metalencased space pirate 
out of the vat and stands him on the platform  Some Ugnaughts rush 
over and push the block over onto the platform  They slide the 
coffinlike structure to the block and lift the metal block placing it 
inside  They then attach an electronic box onto the structure and step 
away  Lando kneels and adjusts some knobs measuring the heat  He 
shakes his head in relief

				VADER
		Well Calrissian did he survive

				LANDO
		Yes hes alive  And in perfect 
		hibernation

Vader turns to Boba Fett

				VADER
		Hes all yours bounty hunter
		Reset the chamber for Skywalker

				IMPERIAL OFFICER
		Skywalker has just landed my 
		lord

				VADER
		Good  See to it that he finds 
		his way here  Calrissian take 
		the princess and the Wookiee to 
		my ship

				LANDO
		You said theyd be left in the 
		city under my supervision

				VADER
		I am altering the deal  Pray I 
		dont alter it any further

Landos hand instinctively goes to his throat as he turns to Leia 
Chewie and Threepio

INT CLOUD CITY  CORRIDOR  DAY

As Luke and Artoo move carefully down a deserted corridor they hear a 
group of people coming down a side hallway  Artoo lets out an excited 
series of beeps and whistles  Luke glares at the tiny droid who stops 
in his tracks with a feeble squeak

Boba Fett enters from a side hallway followed by two guards pushing the 
floating encased body of Han Solo  Two stormtroopers who follow 
immediately spot Luke and open fire on him  The youth draws his weapon 
and blasts the two troopers before they can get off a second shot  The 
two guards whisk Han into another hallway as Fett lowers his arm and 
fires a deadly laser at Luke which explodes to one side and tears up a 
huge chunk of wall

Luke rushes to a side hallway but by the time he reaches it Fett 
Han and the guards are gone  A think metal door blocks the passage  
Luke turns to see Leia Chewie Threepio and Lando being herded down a 
second hallway by several other stormtroopers  Leia turns just in time 
to see Luke

				LEIA
		Luke  Luke dont  its a 
		trap  Its a trap

Before she can finish she is pulled through a doorway and disappears 
from sight  Luke races after the group leaving little Artoo trailing 
behind

INT CLOUD CITY  ANTEROOM

Luke runs into an anteroom and stops to get his bearings  Leia and the 
others are nowhere to be seen  Behind Luke Artoo scoots down the 
corridor toward the anteroom when suddenly a giant metal door comes 
slamming down cutting off Lukes exit  Several more doors clang shut 
echoing through the chamber

INT CLOUD CITY  HALLWAY LEADING TO ANTEROOM

Artoo stands with his nose pressed against the giant metal door  He 
whistles a long sigh of relief and a little dazed wanders off in the 
other direction

INT CLOUD CITY  CARBONFREEZING CHAMBER  ANTEROOM

Luke cautiously walks forward among hissing pipes and steam  Seeing an 
opening above him he stops to look up  As he does the platform he 
stands on begins to move

INT CLOUD CITY  CARBONFREEZING CHAMBER

Luke rises into the chamber borne by the platform  The room is 
deathly quiet  Very little steam escapes the pipes and no one else 
seems to be in the large room  Warily Luke walks toward the stairway

Steam begins to build up in the chamber  Looking up through the steam 
Luke sees a dark figure standing on a walkway above him  Luke holsters 
his gun and moves up the stairs to face Vader  He feels confident 
eager to engage his enemy

				VADER
		The Force is with you young 
		Skywalker  But you are not a 
		Jedi yet

Luke ignites his sword in answer  In an instant Vaders own sword is 
lit  Luke lunges but Vader repels the blow  Again Luke attacks and 
the swords of the two combatants clash in battle

INT CLOUD CITY  CORRIDOR

Leia Lando and Chewie with Threepio on his back march along 
guarded by six stormtroopers  The group reaches an intersection where 
Lobot and a dozen of Landos guards stand at attention

The guards immediately aim their weapons at the startled stormtroopers  
Taking the stormtroopers weapons from them Lobot hands one to Leia 
and one to Lando

				LANDO
		Well done  Hold them in the 
		security tower  and keep it 
		quiet  Move

As Landos guards quickly march the stormtroopers away Lando begins to 
undo Chewies binding

				LEIA
		What do you think youre doing

				LANDO
		Were getting out of here

				THREEPIO
		I knew all along it had to be a 
		mistake

Chewie turns on Lando and starts to choke him

				LEIA
		Do you think that after what you 
		did to Han were going to trust 
		you

Lando tries to free himself from Chewie

				LANDO
			choking
		I had no choice

Chewie barks ferociously

				THREEPIO
			to Chewie
		What are you doing  Trust him 
		trust him

				LEIA
		Oh so we understand dont we 
		Chewie  He had no choice

				LANDO
		Im just trying to help

				LEIA
		We dont need any of your help

				LANDO
			choking
		Haaa

				LEIA
		What

				THREEPIO
		It sounds like Han

				LANDO
		Theres still a chance to save 
		Han I mean at the East 
		Platform

				LEIA
		Chewie

Chewie finally releases Lando who fights to get his breath back

				THREEPIO
			to Lando
		Im terribly sorry about all this 
		After all hes only a Wookiee

EXT CLOUD CITY  EAST LANDING PLATFORM  BOBA FETTS SHIP

The two guards slide Hans encased body into an opening in the side of 
the bounty hunters ship  Boba Fett climb aboard on a ladder next to 
the cargo hold

				BOBA FETT
		Put Captain Solo in the cargo 
		hold

And with that the door slams shut

INT CLOUD CITY  CORRIDOR

Lando Leia and Chewie run down a Cloud City corridor when suddenly 
they spot Artoo who rushes toward them beeping wildly

				THREEPIO
		Artoo  Artoo  Where have you 
		been

Chewie turns around to see the stubby droid causing Threepio to be 
spun out of sight of his friend

				THREEPIO
		Turn around you wooly 
			to Artoo
		Hurry hurry  Were trying to 
		save Han from the bounty hunter

Whistling frantically to Threepio Artoo scoots along with the racing 
group

				THREEPIO
		Well at least your still in 
		one piece  Look what happened to 
		me

EXT EAST LANDING PLATFORM  SIDE BAY

An elevator door slides open and Lando Leia and Chewbacca race for a 
large bay overlooking the East Landing Platform

Just as they arrive Boba Fetts ship takes off against a cloudy sunset 
sky  

In wild anguish Chewie howls and starts firing at the ship

				THREEPIO
		Oh no  Chewie theyre behind 
		you

A laser bolt explodes near the princess  Everyone turns to see what 
Threepio has already spotted coming from the other direction a squad 
of stormtroopers running toward them  Artoo peeks out from the 
elevator

Leia and Chewbacca start firing at the troopers as Lando makes a break 
for the elevator  Laser bolts continue to explode around the princess 
and the Wookiee but they refuse to budge  Lando sticks his head out 
of the elevator and motions for the pair to run but they barely 
notice  They seem possessed transported as all the frustration of 
captivity and anger of loss pour through their deathdealing weapons

But after a few moments they begin to move through the rain of laser 
fire toward the elevator  Once they are inside the door slams shut 
and the stormtroopers race forward

INT CLOUD CITY  CARBONFREEZING CHAMBER

Luke and Vader are locked in combat on the platform overlooking the 
chamber  Their swords clash the platform sways  Luke aggressively 
drives Vader back forcing Vader to use defensive tactics

				VADER
		You have learned much young one

				LUKE
		Youll find Im full of surprises

Vader makes two quick moves hooking Lukes sword out of his hand and 
sending it flying  Another lightning move at Lukes feet forces the 
youth to jump back to protect himself  Losing his balance Luke rolls 
down the stairs to the circular carbonfreezing platform  There he 
sprawls on the floor surprised and shaken  Just in time he looks up 
to see Vader like a giant black bird flying right at him  Luke rolls 
away as Vader lands  Crouching Luke keeps his gaze steadily on his 
enemy

				VADER
		Your destiny lies with me 
		Skywalker  ObiWan knew this to 
		be true

				LUKE
		No

Behind Luke the hydraulic elevator cover has opened noiselessly  All 
the while Luke slowly cautiously moves back away from the Dark Lord

Suddenly Vader attacks so forcefully that Luke loses his balance and 
falls back into the opening  There is a rumble and in an instant 
freezing steam rises to obscure Vaders vision   Vader turns aside and 
deactivates his sword

				VADER
		All to easy  Perhaps you are not 
		as strong as the Emperor thought

Through the steam behind Vader something blurs upward  Liquid metal 
begins to pour into the pit

Vader turns around  and then looks up  He sees Luke who has leaped 
fifteen feet straight up and who now hangs from some hoses on the 
carbonite outlet

				VADER
		Impressive most impressive

Luke jumps down to the platform where he is separated from Vader by the 
steaming carbonite pit  He raises his hand  His sword which had 
fallen on another part of the platform swiftly jumps into his 
outstretched hand and is instantly ignited  Vader immediately lights 
his sword as well

				VADER
		ObiWan has taught you well  You 
		have controlled your fear now 
		release your anger

Luke is more cautious controlling his anger  He begins to retreat as 
Vader goads him on  As Luke takes a defensive position he realizes he 
has been foolhardy  A quick sword exchange and Luke forces Vader back  
Another exchange and Vader retreats  Luke presses forward

				VADER
		Only your hatred can destroy me

Breathing hard Luke jumps in the air turning a somersault over Vader  
He lands on the floor and slashes at Vader as the room continues to 
fill up with steam

Vader retreats before Lukes skillful sword  Vader blocks the sword 
but looses his balance and falls into the outer rim of pipes  The 
energy Luke has used to stop Vader has brought him to the point of 
collapse  Luke moves to the edge and looks down but sees no sign of 
Vader  He then deactivates his sword hooks it on his belt and lowers 
himself into the pit

INT CLOUD CITY  TUNNEL AND REACTOR CONTROL ROOM

Moving through a tunnellike entrance Luke cautiously approaches the 
reactor room  He ignites his sword and moves into the room and toward 
a large window as Vader enters

Luke raises his sword and moves forward to attack

Behind Luke a large piece of machinery detaches itself from the wall 
and comes smashing forward toward his back  Luke turns and cuts it in 
half just as another machine comes hurtling at him  Using the Force 
Luke manages to deflect it and send it flying as if it had hit an 
invisible shield

A large pipe detaches and comes flying at Luke  He deflects it  
Sparking wires pull out of the wall and begin to whip at the youth  
Small tools and equipment come flying at him  Bombardment from all 
sides Luke does his best to deflect everything but soon he is 
bloodied and bruised  Finally one machine glances off his and goes 
flying out the large window  A fierce wind blows into the room 
unmoving stands the dark rocklike figure of Vader

A piece of machinery hits Luke and he is knocked out of the window

INT GANTRY  OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM  REACTOR SHAFT

Luke falls onto the gantry rolls and hangs over the edge holding his 
deactivated sword in hand  He puts the sword on his belt and begins to 
scramble up

INT CLOUD CITY  CORRIDOR LEADING TO LANDING PLATFORM

Leia Lando Chewie and the droids come round a corner and head for the 
door to the landing platform  They glimpse the Millennium Falcon for a 
moment before the door slams shut  The group ducks into an alcove as 
stormtroopers arrive at the end of the corridor  The troopers send a 
rain of laser bolts at the group  Chewie returns their fire as Lando 
punches desperately at the doors control panel

				LANDO
		The security codes has been changed

				THREEPIO
		Artoo you can tell the computer 
		to override the security system

Threepio points to a computer socket on the control panel  Artoo beeps 
and scoots toward it  Lando meanwhile has connected up to the panels 
intercom

				LANDO
		Attention  This is Lando
		Calrissian  The Empire has takes 
		control of the city  I advise 
		everyone to leave before more 
		Imperial troops arrive

Artoo takes off a computer cover and sticks his computer arm into the 
socket  Suddenly a short beep turns into a wild scream  Artoos 
circuits light up his head spins wildly and smoke begins to seep out 
underneath him  Quickly Chewie pulls him away

				LANDO
		This way

Lando Leia Artoo and Chewie flee down the corridor  As he scoots 
along with them Artoo sends some angry beeps Threepios way

				THREEPIO
		Dont blame me  Im an interpreter 
		Im not supposed to know a power 
		socket from a computer terminal

INT CLOUD CITY  CORRIDOR

In a panic Cloud City residents are trying to get out of the city  
Some carry boxes others packages  They run then change direction  
Some are shooting at stormtroopers others simply try to hide

Other stormtroopers pursue Lando Leia and Chewie who are firing back 
at them  Artoo works on another door to the landing platform while 
Threepio berates him for his seeming ineptitude

				THREEPIO
		What are you talking about  Were 
		not interested in the hyperdrive 
		on the Millennium Falcon  Its 
		fixed  Just open the door you 
		stupid lump

Chewie Leia and Lando retreat along the corridor  A triumphant beep 
from Artoo  and the door snaps open

				THREEPIO
			to Artoo
		I never doubted you for a second
		Wonderful

Artoo lays a cloud fog obscuring everything as the group dashes 
outside

EXT LANDING PLATFORM  CLOUD CITY  DUSK

They race for the Millennium Falcon as a battalion of stormtroopers 
reaches the main door  Lando and Leia hold off the troops as the 
droids get on board with Chewie  As Chewie bounds to the ship the 
Threepio on his back Threepio hits his head on the top of the ramp

				THREEPIO
		Ouch  Oh  Ah  That hurt  Bend 
		down you thoughtless Ow

Chewie starts up the ship  The giant engines begin to whine as Lando 
and Leia race up the ramp under a hail of laser fire

				LANDO
		Leia  Go

INT MILLENNIUM FALCON  CORRIDOR

Artoo drags the partially assembled Threepio down the corridor of the 
Falcon

				THREEPIO
		I thought that hairy beast would 
		be the end of me  Of course Ive 
		looked better

Artoo beeps understandingly

INT MILLENNIUM FALCON  COCKPIT

Chewie works the controls as Leia sits in Hans seat and Lando watches 
over their shoulders  As Chewie pulls back on the throttle the ship 
begins to move

EXT CLOUD CITY  LANDING PLATFORM  DUSK

The Millennium Falcon lifts gracefully into the twilight sky and roars 
away from the city  Troops fire after it and TIE fighters take off in 
pursuit

INT GANTRY  OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM  REACTOR SHAFT

Luke moves along the railing and up to the control room

Vader lunges at him and Luke immediately raises his lit sword to meet 
Vaders  Sparks fly as they duel Vader gradually forcing Luke 
backward toward the gantry

				VADER
		You are beaten  It is useless 
		to resist  Dont let yourself 
		be destroyed as ObiWan did

Luke answers by rolling sideways and thrusting his sword at Vader so 
viciously that he nicks Vader on the shoulder  The black armor sparks 
and smokes and Vader seems to be hurt but immediately recovers

Luke backs off along the narrow end of the gantry as Vader comes at 
him slashing at the young Jedi with his sword  Luke makes a quick 
move around the instrument complex attached to the end of the gantry  
Vaders sword comes slashing down cutting the complex loose it begins 
to fall then is caught by the rising wind and blown upward

Luke glances at the instrument complex floating away  At that instant 
Vaders sword comes down across Lukes right forearm cutting off his 
hand and sending his sword flying  In great pain Luke squeezes his 
forearm under his left armpit and moves back along the gantry to its 
extreme end  Vader
follows  The wind subsides  Luke holds on  There is nowhere else to 
go  

				VADER
		There is no escape  Dont make 
		me destroy you  You do not yet 
		realize your importance  You 
		have only begun to discover your 
		power  Join me and I will complete 
		your training  With our combined 
		strength we can end this destructive 
		conflict and bring order to the 
		galaxy

				LUKE
		Ill never join you

				VADER
		If you only knew the power of the 
		dark side  ObiWan never told 
		you what happened to your father

				LUKE
		He told me enough  It was you 
		who killed him

				VADER
		No  I am your father

Shocked Luke looks at Vader in utter disbelief

				LUKE
		No  No  Thats not true  
		Thats impossible

				VADER
		Search your feelings  You know 
		it to be true

				LUKE
		No  No  No

				VADER
		Luke  You can destroy the Emperor
		He has foreseen this  It is your 
		destiny  Join me and together 
		we can rule the galaxy as father 
		and son  Come with me  It is the 
		only way

Vader puts away his sword and holds his hand out to Luke

A calm comes over Luke and he makes a decision  In the next instant 
he steps off the gantry platform into space  The Dark Lord looks over 
the platform and sees Luke falling far below  The wind begins to blow 
at Vaders cape and the torrent finally forces him back away from the 
edge  The wind soon fades and the wounded Jedi begins to drop fast 
unable to grab onto anything to break his fall

INT REACTOR SHAFT

Suddenly Luke is sucked into an exhaust pipe in the side of the shaft  
When Vader sees this he turns and hurries off the platform

INT EXHAUST PIPE

Luke tumbles through the exhaust pipe

He slides to the end of the slickly polished pipe and stops as his feet 
hit a circular grill and knock it open  Luke claws at the surface of 
the pipe trying to keep from sliding out into space

EXT BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY  WEATHER VANE  DUSK

Unable to hang onto the pipe Luke tumbles out emerging at the 
undermost part of Cloud City  Reaching out desperately he manages to 
grab onto on electronic weather vane

				LUKE
		Ben Ben please

Luke tries to pull himself up on the weather vane but slips back down  
He hooks one of his legs around the fragile instruments  All the 
while a powerful current of air rushes out at him from the exhaust 
pipe

				LUKE
		Ben  Leia

There is an ominous cracking sound from the base of the
weather vane and a piece breaks off falling into the clouds far below

				LUKE
		Hear me  Leia

INT MILLENNIUM FALCON  COCKPIT

Leia seems to be lost in a fog her expression troubled  Chewie is 
busy operating the ship  Lando stands next to the Wookiee watching a 
readout on the control panel

				LEIA
		Luke Weve got to go back

Chewie growls in surprise

				LANDO
		What

				LEIA
		I know where Luke is

				LANDO
		But what about those fighter

Chewie barks in agreement with Lando

				LEIA
		Chewie just do it

				LANDO
		But what about Vader

Chewie turns on Lando the newcomer with an ominous growl

				LANDO
		All right all right all right

EXT CLOUD CITY  MILLENNIUM FALCON  DUSK

The Falcon makes a graceful banking turn back toward Cloud City

EXT CLOUD CITY  LANDING PLATFORM

Vader enters the landing platform and watches as the speck that is the 
Falcon disappears  The wind blows at his cape

He turns to two aides who are standing near the entrance to the landing 
platform

				VADER
		Bring my shuttle

Nearly unconscious Luke hangs upsidedown on the weather vane as his 
body shifts in the wind

		Slow down and well get under him
		Lando open the top hatch

Lando rushes out of the cockpit

EXT BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY  WEATHER VANE

Luke hangs by one arm from the crossbar of the weather vane  He slips 
from the bar and grabs onto the pole of the vane as the Falcon banks 
toward him  The Falcon positions itself under Luke as Lando moves up 
through the opening of the hatch  Luke begins to slide and finally 
falls from the vane into space

INT MILLENNIUM FALCON  COCKPIT

Out the cockpit window Leia sees Luke falling from the bottom of the 
city  The ship gains on him

				LEIA
		Okay  Easy Chewie

The Falcon closes in on Luke

and Chewie struggle with the controls

Explosions erupt all around the cockpit buffeting the ship wildly  
Chewie howls as he frantically tries to control the ship

Leia and Chewie turns to see Luke bloody and battered enter the 
cockpit supported by Lando  Leia jumps up and hugs him while Chewie 
barks in joyous relief

Luke rests on a cot his injured arm wrapped in a protective cuff  
Leia gently wipes his face  The ship lurches again

				LEIA
		Ill be back

She kisses him then leaves the quarters

INT MILLENNIUM FALCON  COCKPIT

All over the ship muted alarm buzzers sound  Lando anxiously watches 
the flashing lights on the control panel and hurriedly adjusts some 
switches  Seated next to him Chewie points out a new blip appearing 
on the panel  Leia watching over their shoulders recognizes the 
shape

				LEIA
		Star Destroyer

				LANDO
		All right Chewie  Ready for 
		lightspeed

				LEIA
		If your people fixed the 
		hyperdrive

Another explosion rocks the ship  Leia notices as a green light on the 
panel next to her flashes on

				LEIA
		All the coordinates are set
		Its now or never

Chewie barks in agreement

				LANDO
		Punch it

The Wookiee shrugs and pulls back on the lightspeed throttle  The 
sound of the ion engine changesit is winding up  Faces are tense 
expectant  But nothing happens and the engine goes off  Chewie lets 
out a frustrated howl  The flak still violently rocks the ship

				LANDO
		They told me they fixed it  I 
		trusted them to fix it  Its not 
		my fault

Chewie gets up from his chair and starts out of the cockpit  He gives 
Lando and angry shove as he storms past him

		Noisy brute  Why dont we just 
		go into lightspeed

Artoo beeps in response

				THREEPIO
		We cant  How would you know the

Artoo whistles knowingly

				THREEPIO
		The citys central computer told

Chewie is in the pit  He is trying to loosen something with an 
enormous wrench  Frustrated he uses the wrench like a club and hits 
the panel
